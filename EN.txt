2. TRAINING COMPUTER PARTS

1.

Polar RS800CX training computer: displays and records your heart rate and other exercise data during
exercise.

2.

Polar Polar H3 heart rate sensor: sends the heart rate signal to the training computer. Includes a
connector and strap.

CD-ROM: The CD includes Polar ProTrainer 5

TM

software and a complete user manual.

Polarpersonaltrainer.con web service: Polarpersonaltrainer.com is your online training diary and interactive
training community that keeps you motivated.

The latest version of this user manual can be downloaded at www.polar.com/support.

Optional Accessories

1.

Polar s3/s3+ stride sensorTM W.I.N.D.: transmits the running speed/pace and distance measurements to
the training computer. Also measures running cadence and stride length.

2.

Polar G3/G5 GPS sensorTM W.I.N.D.: provides speed, distance and location data, as well as track
information, in all outdoor sports using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. You can transfer
your track data to the Polar ProTrainer 5 software to view in Google Earth or to convert into a GPX file.
For more information, see software help.

3.

Polar Cycling Speed SensorTM W.I.N.D.: measures speed and distance when cycling.

4.

Polar Cadence Sensor

TM

W.I.N.D.: measures cadence, i.e. crank revolutions per minute when cycling.

When using the Polar G3/G5 GPS sensor with a Polar s3/s3+ stride sensor or Polar cycling speed sensor, the GPS
will only be used for location and route tracking. However, when the s3/s3+ stride sensor or cycling speed sensor is
not in range (e.g. the type of sport changes during training), the training computer automatically retrieves speed
and distance data from the GPS sensor. This way the speed and distance measurement is secured throughout your
training session. To start using the s3/s3+ stride sensor or the cycling speed sensor again, long press LIGHT and
select Seek sensor.
For video tutorials on how to use these accessories, go to http://www.polar.com/en/polar_community/videos.

Prepare For Training

ENGLISH

Calibrate the Polar s3/s3+ Stride Sensor W.I.N.D.
Optional calibration of the s3/s3+ sensor* improves accuracy of speed, pace, and distance measurements.
It is recommended that you calibrate the sensor before using it for the first time, if there are significant
changes in your running style, or if the position of the sensor on the shoe is dramatically changed (e.g. if
you have new running shoes). You can calibrate the sensor by running a known distance, or by setting the
calibration factor manually.

You can calibrate one s3/s3+ sensor for each shoe setting.

Calibrate Sensor by Running a Distance (on-the-fly calibration)
You can calibrate the sensor at any phase of your exercise with lap distance correction, provided you are
not exercising with distance-based targets. Just run a known distance, preferably more than 1000 meters.
Make sure the sensor function in the training computer is on (Settings > Features > Shoes/bikes > Shoes
1/2/3 > On).
In time mode press OK once. Select Settings > Shoes/bikes > Shoes 1/2/3.
Then select Start and start running.
When you are in a starting point of a known lap distance, press OK. When you have run the whole lap
distance, press OK. Then calibrate the sensor by choosing either alternative:
1.

Press and hold LIGHT to go to Settings. Or,

2.

Press STOP once. Select Settings.

Select Calibrate > Correct lap > Set true lap distance . Fix the displayed lap distance with the distance
you just ran, and press OK.
Calibration complete and the factor are displayed. The sensor is now calibrated and ready for action.

Set Calibration Factor Manually
The calibration factor is calculated as a ratio of the actual distance to the uncalibrated distance. Example:
you run 1200m, the training computer shows a distance of 1180m, the calibration factor is 1.000.
Calculate the new calibration factor as follows: 1.000*1200/1180 = 1.017. The measuring range for the
factor is 0.500-1.500.
There are four options for setting the calibration factor:
1.

Before exercise.

Select Settings > Features > Shoes/bikes > Shoe 1/2/3 > Calibrate .
Set the Calibration factor and press OK. The sensor is now calibrated.
2.

During exercise by pausing exercise recording.

Start exercising by pressing OK twice in the time display. Press STOP once and the exercise recording is
paused.
Select Settings > Calibrate > Set factor .
Set the Calibration factor and press OK. The sensor is now calibrated. Continue exercise recording by
pressing OK.
3.

During exercise without pausing exercise recording.

Start exercising by pressing OK twice in the time display. Press and hold LIGHT to get to Settings.
Select Calibrate > Set factor .

4.

Moisten the electrode area of the strap.
Attach the connector to the strap.
Tie the strap around your chest, just below the chest muscles, and attach the hook to the other end of
the strap.
Adjust the strap length to fit tightly but comfortably. Check that the moist electrode areas are firmly
against your skin and that the Polar logo of the connector is in a central and upright position.

Detach the connector from the strap and rinse the strap under running water after every use. Sweat and
moisture may keep the electrodes wet and the heart rate sensor activated. This will reduce the heart rate
sensor battery life. For more detailed washing instructions, see Care and Maintenance (page 60).

The Polar H3 heart rate sensor can be used with specific apparel that has built-in soft textile electrodes. Wet the
electrode areas of the apparel. Clip the connector of the heart rate sensor straight onto the apparel without the
strap so that the connector’s Polar logo is in an upright position.

To lock/unlock the zone, press and hold OK.
During programmed exercises: Press and hold OK and select Lock zone/Unlock zone from the Lap menu.
If, for example, you are running with a heart rate of 130 bpm which is 75% of your maximum heart rate,
and matches sport zone 3, you can press and hold OK to lock your heart rate into this zone. Sport zone3
Locked 70%-79% is displayed. An alarm sounds if you are below or above the sport zone (if the target zone
alarm function is on). Unlock the sport zone by pressing and holding OK again: Sport zone3 Unlocked is
displayed.
Using the software, you can also base ZoneLock on your speed/pace or cadence*. For further information,
see software help.

Determine Your OwnZone
For background information on Polar OwnZone®, see OwnZone Training (page 54).
Find your OwnZone in 1-5 minutes during a warm-up period by walking and jogging. You should start
exercising gently at a light intensity and gradually increase intensity to raise your heart rate.
Redefine your OwnZone:
• When changing exercise environment or exercise mode.
• When taking up exercise after more than a week’s break.
• If you are not 100 percent sure of your physical or mental state – for example, if you are not recovered
from previous training, not feeling well, or are stressed.
• After changing user settings.
Before you start to determine your OwnZone, make sure that:
• Your user settings are correct.
• You select the OwnZone exercise. Every time you start the OwnZone exercise, the training computer will
automatically determine your OwnZone.
1.
2.

Wear the heart rate sensor and stride sensor* as instructed. Start measurement by pressing OK twice.
When your exercise starts, OZ is displayed and OwnZone determination begins.

Determination of your OwnZone happens in five stages. After each stage, you will hear a beep (if the
sound settings are on) indicating the end of the stage.
OZ > Walk at a slow pace for 1 min. Keep your heart rate below 100 bpm / 50% HR max during this first

stage.
OZ >> Walk at a normal pace for 1 min. Slowly increase your heart rate by 10-20 bpm / 5% HR max.

ENGLISH

OZ >>> Walk at a brisk pace for 1 min. Increase your heart rate by 10-20 bpm / 5% HR max.
OZ >>>> Jog at a slow pace for 1 min. Increase your heart rate by 10-20 bpm / 5% HRmax.
OZ >>>>> Jog at a brisk pace or run for 1 min. Increase your heart rate by approximately 10 bpm/ 5 %

HRmax.
3.
4.

5.

At some point during the session, you will hear two consecutive beeps. This means your OwnZone has
been determined.
If determination was successful, OwnZone Updated and the zone are displayed. The zone is displayed in
beats per minute (bpm), as a percentage of maximum heart rate (HR%), or as a percentage of your heart
rate reserve (HRR%) depending on your settings.
If OwnZone determination was not successful, your previously determined OwnZone will be used and
OwnZone Limits is displayed. If OwnZone has not previously been recorded, age-based limits are
automatically applied.

You can now continue with your exercise. Try to keep inside the given heart rate zone to maximize exercise
benefits.
Alternatively, to skip OwnZone determination and use the previously determined OwnZone, press OK at
any phase of the process.

The elapsed time used for OwnZone determination is included in your exercise recording time.

7. SETTINGS
Feature Settings
A new sensor purchased as a separate accessory has to be introduced to the training computer. This is
called teaching and takes only a few seconds. Teaching ensures that your training computer receives
signals from your sensor only, and enables disturbance-free exercise in a group. If you have purchased the
sensor and the training computer as a set, the sensor has already been “taught” to work together with the
training computer. You just need to activate the sensor in your training computer.
When you activate a sensor in feature settings, Teach new sensor? is displaeyd. You can teach a new
sensor by selecting Yes. Select No if the sensor has already been taught.

To teach a separately purchased H3 heart rate sensor, see Teach a New Heart Rate Sensor (page ).

Wheel sizes on the chart are advisory as wheel size depends on the wheel type and air pressure.
Method 2
Measure the wheel manually for the most accurate result.
Use the valve to mark the point where the wheel touches the ground. Draw a line on the ground to mark
that point. Move your bike forward on a flat surface for one complete rotation. The tire should be
perpendicular to the ground. Draw another line on the ground at the valve to mark a full rotation. Measure
the distance between the two lines.
Subtract 4 mm to account for your weight on the bike to get your wheel circumference. Enter this value in
the cycling computer.

Altitude
The training computer converts measured air pressure into an altitude reading. Change the settings of the
altimeter in the Altitude menu. You can calibrate the altimeter manually or automatically.
Set the altitude function on or off
Select Settings > Features > Altitude > On / Off
Calibrating the Altitude Manually
Select Settings > Features > Altitude > Calibrate > set the altitude of current location
If the altitude of your location differs significantly from the displayed altitude value Calibrate to xx? is
displayed.
• Yes: Altitude calibrated to xx is displayed.
• No: Altitude calibration canceled is displayed. The last altitude value stored in the training computer’s
memory is applied.
Calibrate the altitude to ensure it remains accurate. Set the reference altitude whenever a reliable
reference, such as a peak or a topographic map, is available or when at sea level.
Calibrating the Altitude Automatically
Select Settings > Features > Altitude > AutoCalib > On / Off
When automatic calibration is on, the last altitude value stored in the training computer’s memory is
applied when exercising. This feature is especially useful if you always start a session in the same
environment. If automatic calibration fails, you are not in the usual environment and will need to calibrate
the altitude manually.
Altitude calibrated to xx m/ft indicates that calibration has succeeded. If Altitude calibration failed is

displayed, re-calibrate the altitude.

Recording Rate
Select Settings > Features > Rec.rate > 1 / 2 / 5 / 15 / 60 sec
The training computer can store your heart rate, speed/pace,* and altitude in 1, 2, 5, 15 or 60 second
intervals. A longer interval gives you more recording time, while a shorter interval allows you to record
more heart and other data. This enables accurate data analysis using the software.
A shorter recording rate consumes the memory of the training computer more rapidly. The remaining
recording time is displayed on the lower row when setting the rate. Default recording rate is 5 seconds.
When less than 30 minutes of maximum recording time is left, the recording rate changes automatically to
longer recording time (1s > 2s > 5s > 15s > 60s). This will maximize the time to record exercise data.
When the session ends, the current recording rate remains as default.
The following table shows the maximum recording times for each recording rate. Note that recording rate
might change when there is less than 30 minutes of recording time left.

** This is a sum of 2 or more exercises; maximum duration of a single exercise is 99 h 59 min 59 s. The
maximum recording time can be shorter, if you record a large number of short exercises.

The durations in the table are estimates. For RR data, maximum recording time depends on heart rate and
variation of heart rate. If you record laps in your exercise, and/or if you have created an exercise that includes
phases with the software, the maximum recording time will decrease.
Recording doesn't automatically stop when the memory becomes full. Therefore, exercise time may be
longer than recording time.

RR Data Function
Select Settings > Features > RR data > On / Off
The RR data recording function measures and records heartbeat variations within one millisecond
resolution. This enables the analysis (accuracy 1ms) of heart rate variability (HRV) using the software. The
RR data function consumes the memory of the training computer, therefore when setting the function, the
remaining recording time is shown on the lower row of the display.

Activity Level
Activity level is an assessment of your level of long-term physical activity. Select the alternative that best
describes the overall amount and intensity of your physical activity during the past three months.
• Top: You participate in heavy physical exercise at least 5 times a week, or you exercise to improve
performance for competitive purposes.
• High: You participate at least 3 times a week in heavy physical exercise, e.g. you run 20-50 km/12-31
miles per week or spend 3-5 hours per week in comparable physical activity.
• Moderate: You participate regularly in recreational sports, e.g. you run 5-10 km or 3-6 miles per week or
spend 1/2-2 hours per week in comparable physical activity, or your work requires modest physical
activity.
• Low: You do not participate regularly in programmed recreational sport or heavy physical activity, e.g. you
walk only for pleasure or exercise hard enough to cause heavy breathing or perspiration only occasionally.
In the training computer, these values are used to calculate your energy expenditure.
Heart Rate: HRmax, HRsit
HRmax (Maximum heart rate): Your age-predicted HR max value (220 - age) is used as a default. Set your
HRmax manually if your maximum heart rate has been determined in a lab, or if you have tested your
maximum heart rate in the field yourself.
HRsit (Heart rate value in a sitting position): Set your HRsit value if you have determined it according to
the instructions. For instructions, see Heart Rate Value in a Sitting Position (page 55).
Maximal Oxygen Intake: VO2max
VO2max is your body’s maximum capacity for oxygen consumption during maximum exertion. The most
accurate way of determining VO2max is to perform a maximal stress test in a laboratory. If you know your
exact clinically-tested VO2max, set the value in the training computer. Otherwise, measure a comparable
value, OwnIndex, by taking the Polar Fitness Test. For further information, see Polar Fitness Test TM
(page ? ).
If changes are made to the user settings, User settings updated is displayed.

You can change settings easily by using the software. For further information, see software help.

9. TESTS
Polar Fitness Test TM

The Polar Fitness Test TM is an easy, safe, and quick way to measure your aerobic (cardiovascular) fitness
at rest. The result, Polar OwnIndex, is comparable to maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), which is commonly
used to evaluate aerobic fitness. Your long-term level of physical activity, heart rate, heart rate variability
at rest, gender, age, height, and body weight all influence OwnIndex. The Polar Fitness Test is developed
for use by healthy adults.
Aerobic fitness relates to how well your cardiovascular system works to transport oxygen to your body. The
better your aerobic fitness, the stronger and more efficient your heart is. Good aerobic fitness has many
health benefits. For example, it helps in decreasing high blood pressure and your risk of cardiovascular
diseases and stroke. If you want to improve your aerobic fitness it takes, on average, six weeks of regular
training to see a noticeable change in your OwnIndex. Less fit individuals see progress even more rapidly.
The better your aerobic fitness, the smaller the improvements in your OwnIndex.
Aerobic fitness is best improved by exercise types that use large muscle groups. Such activities include
running, cycling, walking, rowing, swimming, skating, and cross-country skiing.
To monitor your progress, start by measuring your OwnIndex a couple of times during the first two weeks
in order to get a baseline value, and then repeat the test approximately once a month.
With the Polar Fitness Test, you can also calculate the predicted maximum heart rate value (HR max-p). The
HRmax-p score predicts your individual maximum heart rate more accurately than the age-based formula
(220 - age). For further information on HRmax, see User Settings (page 37).
To make sure the test results are reliable, the following basic requirements apply:
• You can perform the test anywhere - at home, at the office, at a health club - provided the testing
environment is peaceful. There should be no disturbing noises (e.g. television, radio, or telephone) and no
other people talking to you.
• Always take the test in the same environment and at the same hour.
• Avoid eating a heavy meal or smoking 2-3 hours prior to testing.
• Avoid heavy physical exertion, alcohol, and pharmacological stimulants on the test day and the previous
day.
• You should be relaxed and calm. Lie down and relax for 1-3 minutes before starting the test.

Before the Test
Wear the Heart Rate Sensor
For further information, see Wear the Heart Rate Sensor (page 13).
Enter User Information

ENGLISH

Performing the Test
Select Test > Fitness > Start > Fitness Test Lie Down
The fitness test begins in five seconds. Arrows indicate that the test is ongoing. Stay relaxed and limit
body movements and communication with other people.
If you have not set your long-term physical activity level in User Settings, Set your personal activity level
is displayed. Select Top, High, Moderate , or Low. For further information on activity levels, see User
Settings (page 37).
If your training computer does not receive your heart rate at the beginning or during the test, the test fails
and Test failed, check WearLink is displayed. Check that the heart rate sensor electrodes are wet and that
the textile strap is snug enough, and start the test again.
When the test is over, you will hear two beeps. OwnIndex is displayed with a numerical value and level
evaluation. For further information on evaluations, see Fitness Level Classes.
To display your Predicted maximum heart rate value press DOWN. Press OK to exit.
Update to VO2 max?

•
•

Select Yes to save the OwnIndex value to your user settings and Fitness Test Trend menu.
Select No only if you know your laboratory-measured VO2max value, and if it differs more than one fitness
level class from the OwnIndex result. Your OwnIndex value is saved only to the Fitness Test Trend menu.
For further information, see Fitness Test Trend .

Update to HR max? (if HRmax-p is on)

•
•

Select Yes to save the value to your user settings.
Select No if you know your laboratory-measured HRmax.

You can stop the test at any time by pressing STOP. Fitness Test canceled is displayed for a few seconds.

After saving the OwnIndex and HRmax-p values, they will be used for calculating calorie consumption.

After the Test
Fitness Level Classes
Your OwnIndex is most meaningful when comparing your individual values and changes in them over time.
OwnIndex can also be interpreted based on gender and age. Locate your OwnIndex on the table below, and
find out how your aerobic fitness compares to others of the same gender and age.
Top athletes typically score OwnIndex values above 70 (men) and 60 (women). Olympic-level endurance
athletes can reach values as high as 95. OwnIndex is highest in sports that involve large muscle groups,
such as running and cross-country skiing.

Polar OwnOptimizerTM

General
Successful training requires temporary overloading: longer exercise duration, higher intensity, or higher
total volume. In order to avoid severe overtraining, overloading must always be followed by an adequate
recovery period. With an inadequate recovery period, you may experience a decrease in performance as a
result of high training volumes, instead of improvement. Polar OwnOptimizer is an easy and reliable way to
determine whether your training program is optimally developing your performance. Polar OwnOptimizer is
developed for use by healthy adults.
Polar OwnOptimizer is a modification of a traditional orthostatic overtraining test. It is a perfect tool,
embedded in the training computer, for everyone training regularly, at least three times a week, for fitness
improvement or to reach competitive targets. This feature is based on heart rate and heart rate variability
measurements taken during an orthostatic test (standing up from relaxed resting). OwnOptimizer helps you
to optimize your training load during a training program so that you experience an increase in performance
and do not undertrain or overtrain in the long run. Polar OwnOptimizer is based on regular long-term
measurements of five heart rate parameters. Two of these five values are calculated at rest, one while
standing up, and two while standing. Each time you perform the test, the wrist unit saves the heart rate
values and compares them to the previous values registered.

Before the Test
Baseline Tests
When you use OwnOptimizer for the first time, six baseline tests should be conducted over a period of two
weeks to determine your personal baseline value. These baseline measurements should be taken during
two typical basic training weeks, not during heavy training weeks. The baseline measurements should
include tests taken after a training day and after recovery days.
Monitoring OwnOptimizer Values
After the baseline recordings, you should continue to perform the test 2-3 times a week. Test yourself
weekly in the morning following both a recovery day and a heavy training day (or a series of heavy training
days). An optional third test can be performed after a normal training day. OwnOptimizer may not provide
reliable information during detraining or in a very irregular training period. If you take a break from
exercise for 14 days or longer, the baseline tests should be performed again.

Performing the Test
The test should always be taken in standardized/similar conditions in order to get the most reliable results.
It is recommended that you take the test in the morning before breakfast. The following basic
requirements apply:
• Wear the heart rate sensor.
• You should be relaxed and calm.
• You can be seated in a relaxed position or lying in bed. The position should always be the same when you
do the test.
• The test can take place anywhere – at home, in the office, at a health club – as long as the test
environment is peaceful. There should be no disturbing noises (for example, television, radio or telephone)
or other people talking to you.
• Avoid eating, drinking and smoking 2-3 hours prior to the test.

textile strap fits snugly.

After the Test
How to Interpret Results
The wrist unit calculates five heart rate and heart rate variability based parameters. The OwnOptimizer
values are calculated by comparing your latest results to previous ones. The wrist unit will display a
written description of your training status. The descriptions are defined in detail below.
Good Recovery (1)

Your heart rate is lower than average. This indicates that you have recovered very well. You can continue
training, including intensive exercise sessions.
Normal State (2)

Your heart rate is at a normal level. Go on with your training; include both light and intensive training
sessions, and recovery days.
Training Effect (3)

Your heart rate is higher than average. You may have exercised intensively in the previous days. You have
two choices: 1) rest or train lightly for one or two days, or 2) continue intensive training for one or two
days and then recover well. Other sources of stress such as the beginning of a fever or an attack of the flu
can result in the same kind of response.
Steady State (4)

Your heart rate has continuously been at a normal level for a long time now. Effective training requires
both heavy training and good recovery, and this should cause variation in your heart rate results. Your
OwnOptimizer result indicates that you have not had very intensive training or good recovery for a while.
Perform the test again after a rest or light training day. If the recovery is effective, your result should show
Good recovery.
Stagnant State (5)

Your heart rate is still at a normal level, and this has continued for a long time. The result indicates that
your training has not been intensive enough to develop optimally. To improve your condition effectively,
you should now include more intense or longer exercise sessions in your program.
Hard Training (6)

Your heart rate has been higher than average several times. You may have trained hard on purpose. The
result indicates overloading, and you should try to recover well now. To monitor your recovery, perform the
test again after one or two resting or easy training days.
Overreaching (7)

Your OwnOptimizer result indicates that you have had a very intensive training period for several days or
weeks. Your heart rate has continuously remained at a high level. This seriously indicates that you should

Tests

49

ENGLISH

have a complete recovery period. The longer you have trained intensively, the longer the recovery period
required to recover. Perform the test again after at least two days of recovery.
Sympathetic Overtraining (8)

Your OwnOptimizer result indicates that you have had a very intensive training period for several days or
weeks, and your recovery has not been sufficient. This has resulted in a state of overtraining. To return to
a normal training state, rest for a carefully monitored recovery period. Follow your recovery by performing
the OwnOptimizer Test 2–3 times a week.
Parasympathetic Overtraining (9)

Your heart rate has stayed at a low level, which is generally interpreted as a sign of a good recovery.
However, other parameters indicate parasympathetic overtraining. You may have trained with high volumes
for a long time, and recovery may not have been sufficient. Check for other signs of overtraining, such as
decreased performance, increased fatigue, mood disturbances, sleeping problems, persistent muscle
soreness, and/or a feeling of being burnt out or stale. You may also have been subjected to other stresses.
In general, the development of parasympathetic overtraining requires a long history of heavy training
volumes. To recover from a state of parasympathetic overtraining, you have to recover body balance
completely. Recovering may take several weeks. You should not exercise, instead rest completely for most
of the recovery period. You can possibly have a few days with some light aerobic training in short sessions,
and only occasionally include short, high-intensity sessions.
You can also consider doing other than your main sport. However, it should be one you are familiar and
comfortable with. Monitor your recovery by performing the OwnOptimizer Test 2–3 times a week. Once you
feel you have recovered your body balance, and your result shows Normal State or Good recovery,
preferably more than once, you can then consider resuming training. Once you start training again, begin a
new testing period with new baseline measurements.

Before you radically change your training program, consider your OwnOptimizer results together with your
subjective feelings and any symptoms you may have. Repeat the OwnOptimizer test if you are unsure of the
standardized conditions. An individual test result can be affected by several external factors, such as mental
stress, latent illness, environmental changes (temperature, altitude), and others. You should update the baseline
calculations at least once a year, when you start a new training season.

10. USING A NEW HEART RATE SENSOR
Teach a New Heart Rate Sensor
If you purchase a new heart rate sensor, it has to be introduced to the training computer. This is called
teaching and takes only a few seconds. Teaching ensures that your training computer receives signals from
your heart rate sensor only, and enables disturbance-free exercise in a group.
In time mode, press OK > New WearLink found, Teach new WearLink?
Wear the heart rate sensor and make sure that you are not near (40 m/131 ft) other Polar H3 heart rate
sensors. In time mode, press OK. The training computer starts searching for the heart rate sensor signal.
Once the new heart rate sensor is identified, New WearLink found, Teach new WearLink? is displayed.
• Select YES to confirm teaching. Completed! is displayed. Start exercise recording by pressing OK.
• Select NO to cancel teaching.
To return to time mode, press and hold the STOP button.

11. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Polar Sport Zones
Polar sport zones introduce a new level of effectiveness in heart rate-based training. Training is divided
into five sport zones based on percentages of maximum heart rate. With sport zones, you can easily select
and monitor training intensities.

Training benefit

HRmax = Maximum heart rate (220-age). Example: 30 years old, 220–30=190 bpm.
Exercising in sport zone 1 is done at a very low intensity. The main training principle is that performance
improves when recovering after, and not only during, training. Accelerate the recovery process with very
light intensity training.
Sport zone 2 is for endurance training, an essential part of any training program. Exercise sessions in this
zone are easy and aerobic. Long-duration training in this light zone results in effective energy expenditure.
Progress will require persistence.
Aerobic power is enhanced in sport zone 3. The training intensity is higher than in sport zones 1 and 2,

Background Information

53

ENGLISH

but still mainly aerobic. Training in sport zone 3 may, for example, consist of intervals followed by
recovery. Exercising in this zone is especially effective for improving the efficiency of blood circulation in
the heart and skeletal muscles.
If your goal is to compete at top potential, you will have to train in sport zones 4 and 5. In these zones,
you exercise anaerobically, in intervals of up to 10 minutes. The shorter the interval, the higher the
intensity. Sufficient recovery between intervals is very important. The training pattern in zones 4 and 5 is
designed to produce peak performance.
The Polar sport zones can be personalized by using a laboratory measured HRmax value, or by taking a field
test to measure the value yourself. When exercising in a sport zone, try to make use of the entire zone. The
mid-zone is a good target, but keeping your heart rate at that exact level all the time is not necessary.
Heart rate gradually adjusts to training intensity. For instance, when crossing from sport zone 1 to 3, the
circulatory system and heart rate will adjust in 3-5 minutes.
Heart rate responds to exercise intensity depending on factors such as fitness and recovery levels, as well
as environmental factors. It is important to look out for subjective feelings of fatigue, and to adjust your
training program accordingly.
A simple way of making use of the sport zones is to work with target heart rate zones. For further
instructions, see Plan Your Training (page 9).
After the exercise, exercise duration is displayed in sport zones. Access the Weekly display to see in which
sport zones you have been exercising, and for how long.
The Polar ProTrainer 5 offers up to 10 sport zones to better serve your training needs and heart rate
reserve.

OwnZone Training
Your training computer determines automatically an individual and safe exercise intensity zone: your
OwnZone. The unique Polar OwnZone defines your personal training zone for aerobic training. The function
guides you through your warm-up, and takes your present physical and mental condition into account. For
most adults, OwnZone corresponds to 65-85% of maximum heart rate.
OwnZone can be determined in 1-5 minutes during a warm-up period by walking, jogging, or doing some
other sport. The idea is to start exercising slowly at a light intensity, and to gradually increase intensity
and heart rate. OwnZone is developed for use by healthy people. Some health conditions may cause heart
rate variability-based OwnZone determination to fail. These conditions include high blood pressure,
cardiac arrhythmias, and certain medications.
Listening to and interpreting the signals your body sends during physical exertion is an important part of
getting fit. Since warm-up routines differ for different types of exercise, and since your physical and
mental state may also vary from day to day (due to stress or illness), using the OwnZone function for every
session guarantees the most effective heart rate target zone for that particular type of exercise and day.

Maximum Heart Rate
Maximum heart rate (HRmax) is the highest number of heartbeats per minute (bpm) during maximum
physical exertion. It is individual and depends on age, hereditary factors, and fitness level. It may also
vary according to the type of sport performed. HRmax is used to express exercise intensity.
Determining Maximum Heart Rate
Your HR max can be determined in several ways.
• The most accurate way is to have your HRmax clinically measured, usually on a maximal treadmill or by
taking a bicycle stress test supervised by a cardiologist or exercise physiologist.
• You can also determine your HR max by taking a field test together with a training partner.
• You can obtain a HR max-p score that predicts your HRmax by taking a Polar Fitness Test.
• HRmax can also be estimated by using the commonly used formula: 220 - age, although research shows
that the method is not very accurate, especially for older persons or those who have been fit for many

54

Background Information

ENGLISH

years.
If you have done some hard training in recent weeks and know that you can safely reach maximum heart
rate, you can safely take a test to determine your HRmax yourself. Having a training buddy with you during
the test is recommended. If you are uncertain, consult your physician before undertaking the test.
Here is an example of a simple test.
Step 1: Warm up for 15 minutes on a flat surface, building up to your usual training pace.
Step 2: Choose a hill or stairwell that will take more than 2 minutes to climb. Run up the hill/steps once,
building to as hard a pace as you can hold for 20 minutes. Return to the base of the hill/steps.
Step 3: Run up the hill/steps again, building towards a pace you could just about hold for 3 kilometers.
Note your highest heart rate. Your maximum is approximately 10 beats higher than the noted value.
Step 4: Run back down the hill, allowing your heart rate to drop 30-40 beats per minute.
Step 5: Run up the hill/steps once again at a pace that you can only hold for 1 minute. Try to run halfway
up the hills/steps. Note your highest heart rate. This brings you close to your maximum heart rate. Use this
value as your maximum heart rate to set training zones.
Step 6: Make sure you get a good cool-down, a minimum of 10 minutes.

Heart Rate Value in a Sitting Position
HRsit is your average heart rate when completely still (i.e. while sitting). To easily determine HR sit, wear
your heart rate sensor, sit down, and do not engage in any physical activity. For a more precise
measurement, repeat the procedure several times and calculate your average.

Heart Rate Reserve
Heart rate reserve (HRR) is the difference between maximum heart rate (HRmax), and resting heart rate
(HRrest)*. HRR is used to calculate exercise heart rates. It is the range within which heart rate varies
depending on exertion level. HRR equals oxygen uptake reserve (VO2R).
Exercise heart rate can be determined by using the Karvonen formula**. Add the given percentage of heart
rate reserve to resting heart rate.
Exercise HR = % of target intensity (HRmax – HRrest) + HRrest
Example:
Target intensity 70 % HRR for a person with HR max 201 bpm and HRrest 50 bpm
Exercise HR= 70% (201-50) + 50
Exercise HR=156 bpm
For a precise exercise heart rate, you need your exact HRmax and HRrest. When using estimated HRmax,
exercise heart rate values are always estimates.
*In Polar RS800CX training computer, the heart rate value during a resting state is measured in a sitting
position (HRsit). This is for practical reasons since HRsit is used in energy expenditure calculation because
of accuracy. HR sit matches the low intensity to which different exercise intensities can be compared.
**Karvonen M, Kentala K, Mustala O. The effects of training on heart rate: a longitudinal study. Ann Med
Exp Biol Fenn 1957; 35: 307-315.

Heart Rate Variability
Heart rate varies with every heartbeat. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the variation of beat to beat intervals,
also known as R-R intervals.

Background Information

55

ENGLISH

HRV indicates the fluctuations of heart rate around an average heart rate. An average heart rate of 60
beats per minute (bpm) does not mean that the interval between successive heartbeats would be exactly
1.0 sec, instead they may fluctuate/vary from 0.5 sec up to 2.0 sec.
HRV is affected by aerobic fitness. HRV of a well-conditioned heart is generally large at rest. Other factors
that affect HRV are age, genetics, body position, time of day, and health status. During exercise, HRV
decreases as heart rate and exercise intensity increase. HRV also decreases during periods of mental
stress.
HRV is regulated by the autonomic nervous system. Parasympathetic activity decreases heart rate and
increases HRV, whereas sympathetic activity increases heart rate and decreases HRV.
HRV is used in the Ownzone, OwnIndex, and in OwnOptimizer features. It can also be monitored on its
own using the training computer. If your HRV changes at a given pace and heart rate, this may indicate a
change in your training load and stress.

Running Cadence and Stride Length
Cadence* is the number of times the foot with the stride sensor* hits the ground per minute.
Stride length* is the average length of one step. That is the distance between your right and left foot
contacting the ground.
Running speed = 2 * stride length * cadence
There are two ways to run faster: moving your legs at a higher cadence or taking longer steps.
Elite long distance runners typically run with a high cadence of 85-95. On uphills, typical cadence values
are lower. On downhills they are higher. Runners adjust stride length to gather speed: stride length
increases as speed increases.
Yet one of the most common mistakes novice runners make is over-striding. The most efficient stride
length is the natural one – the one that feels most comfortable. You will run faster in races by
strengthening your leg muscles so they take you forward with a longer stride.
You should also work on maximizing cadence efficiency. Cadence does not progress easily, but if properly
trained, you will be able to sustain it throughout your runs and maximize your performance. To develop
cadence, the nerve-muscle connection needs to be trained - and reasonably frequently. A session of
cadence training a week is a good start. Incorporate some cadence work into the rest of your week. During
long easy runs, you could include some faster cadence every now and then.
When training for longer running events (½ Marathon, Marathon or longer), it may be helpful to monitor
cadence. A low cadence at expected race pace can cause problems later in the event, as your legs tire.

56

Background Information

ENGLISH

One way around this is to work on increasing leg speed at expected race pace. You can set your training
computer to show pace and cadence. Try to shorten your stride and increase cadence while holding the
same pace (set a narrow pace zone to give you audio feedback).You can aim to raise running cadence
above the following:
• 80/min (4hour Marathoners)
• 85/min (3hr 30min Marathoners)
• 88/min (3hour Marathoners)
This is a general guide only, taller runners will naturally have slightly lower cadences. Runners should also
tune in to what feels comfortable for them personally.
A good way of improving stride length is to undertake specific strength work, like running hills, running in
soft sand, or running up steps. A six-week training period including strength work should result in
noticeable improvements in stride length, and if combined with some faster leg speed work (such as short
strides at best 5km pace), noticeable improvements should be seen in overall speed, as well.
*Optional s3/s3+ stride sensor W.I.N.D. required.

R-R Recording
R-R recording rate saves heartbeat intervals, i.e. intervals between successive heartbeats. This information
is also shown as instantaneous heart rate in beats per minute in recorded samples.
When recording every single interval, extra systoles and artefacts can also be seen. We recommend using
contact gel (ECG gel) to optimize contact between your skin and the heart rate sensor. Readings
interpreted as incorrect in the heart rate data can be adjusted and corrected with the software.

Polar Running Index
Running Index offers an easy way to monitor performance changes. Performance (how fast/easily you run
at a given pace) is directly influenced by aerobic fitness (VO2max) and exercise economy (how efficient
your body is at running), and Running Index is a measurement of this influence. By recording your
Running Index over time, you can monitor progress. Improvement means that running at a given pace
requires less of an effort, or that your pace is faster at a given level of exertion. The Running Index feature
calculates such improvements. Running Index also gives you daily information on your running
performance level which may vary from day to day.
Benefits of Running Index:
• emphasizes the positive effects of good training sessions and resting days.
• monitors fitness and performance development at different heart rate levels - not only during maximal
performance.
• you can determine your optimal running speed by comparing running indexes from different kinds of
trainings.
• stresses progress through better running technique and fitness level.
Running Index is calculated during every exercise when heart rate and the s3/s3+ stride sensor/ G3/G5
GPS sensor* signal is recorded, and when the following requirements apply:
• speed should be 6km/h / 3,75 mi/h or faster and duration 12 minutes minimum.
• heart rate should be above 40% HRmax.
Make sure that the stride sensor is calibrated. Calculation begins when you start recording the session.
During the session, you may stop once at traffic lights, for example, without interrupting the calculation.
In the end, your training computer displays a Running Index value and stores the result in the File section.
Compare your result to the table below. Using the software, you can monitor and analyze your progress in
Running Index values against time and different running speeds. Or compare values from different
exercise sessions and analyze them in the short and long term.

Precautions
Interference During Exercise
Electromagnetic Interference and Exercise Equipment
Disturbance may occur near microware ovens and computers. Also WLAN base stations may cause
interference when exercising with RS800CX. To avoid erratic reading or misbehaviors, move away from
possible sources of disturbance.
Exercise equipment with electronic or electrical components such as LED displays, motors and electrical
brakes may cause interfering stray signals. To solve these problems, try the following:
1.
2.

3.

Remove the heart rate sensor from your chest and use the exercise equipment as you would normally.
Move the training computer around until you find an area in which it displays no stray reading or does not
flash the heart symbol. Interference is often worst directly in front of the display panel of the equipment,
while the left or right side of the display is relatively free of disturbance.
Put the heart rate sensor back on your chest and keep the training computer in this interference-free area
as much as possible.

If the training computer still does not work with the exercise equipment, it may be electrically too noisy
for wireless heart rate measurement.
Using RS800 Training Computer in Water
The training computer is water resistant. However, heart rate measurement does not work in water. You
can use the training computer under water as a watch but it is not a diving instrument. To maintain water
resistance, do not press the buttons of the training computer under water. Using the training computer in
excessive rainfall may also cause interference.

Minimizing Risks When Exercising
Exercise may include some risk. Before beginning a regular exercise program, it is recommended that you
answer the following questions concerning your health status. If you answer yes to any of these questions,
we recommend that you consult a doctor before starting any training program.
• Have you been physically inactive for the past 5 years?
• Do you have high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol?
• Are you taking any blood pressure or heart medication?
• Do you have a history of breathing problems?
• Do you have symptoms of any disease?
• Are you recovering from a serious illness or medical treatment?

62

Customer Service Information

ENGLISH

•
•
•

Do you use a pacemaker or other implanted electronic device?
Do you smoke?
Are you pregnant?

Note that in addition to exercise intensity, medications for heart conditions, blood pressure, psychological
conditions, asthma, breathing, etc., as well as some energy drinks, alcohol, and nicotine may also affect
heart rate.
It is important to be sensitive to your body’s responses during exercise. If you feel unexpected pain or
excessive fatigue when exercising, it is recommended that you stop the exercise or continue at a lighter
intensity.
Note! If you are using a pacemaker, you can use Polar training computers. In theory interference to
pacemaker caused by Polar products should not be possible. In practice no reports exist to suggest anyone
ever having experienced interference. We cannot however issue an official guarantee on our products'
suitability with all pacemakers or other implanted devices due to the variety of devices available. If you
have any doubts, or if you experience any unusual sensations while using Polar products, please consult
your physician or contact the implanted electronic device manufacturer to determine safety in your case.
If you are allergic to any substance that comes into contact with your skin or if you suspect an allergic
reaction due to using the product, check the listed materials in Technical Specifications. To avoid any
skin reaction to the heart rate sensor, wear it over a shirt, but moisten the shirt well under the electrodes
to ensure flawless operation.
Your safety is important to us. The shape of the s3/s3+ stride sensor* is designed to minimize the
possibility of it getting caught in something. In any case, be careful when running with the stride sensor in
brushwood, for example.

The combined impact of moisture and intense abrasion may cause a black color to come off the heart rate sensor’s
surface, possibly staining light-colored clothes. If you use insect repellent on your skin, you must ensure that it
does not come into contact with the heart rate sensor.
*Optional s3/s3+ stride sensor W.I.N.D. required.

...there are no reactions to any buttons?
Reset the training computer by pressing all the buttons simultaneously for two seconds until the display
fills with digits. Press any button and set the time and date in Basic Settings after the reset. All other
settings are saved. Skip the rest of the settings by pressing and holding STOP.
...the heart rate reading becomes erratic, extremely high or shows nil (00)?
• Make sure the heart rate sensor strap has not loosened during exercise.
• Make sure the textile electrodes in the sports apparel fit snugly.
• Make sure that the electrodes of the heart rate sensor / sports apparel are moistened.
• Make sure the heart rate sensor / sports apparel is clean.
• Strong electromagnetic signals can cause erratic readings. For further information, see Precautions
(page 62).
• If the erratic heart rate reading continues despite moving away from the source of disturbance, slow down
your speed and check your pulse manually. If you feel it corresponds to the high reading on the display,
you may be experiencing cardiac arrhythmia. Most cases of arrhythmia are not serious, but consult your
doctor nevertheless.
• A cardiac event may have altered your ECG waveform. In this case, consult your physician.
…Memory full is displayed?
The message appears during exercise if you have recorded 99 laps or if no memory space is left for the
exercise. In that case, stop recording the exercise and transfer the exercise files from your training
computer to the Polar ProTrainer 5. Then delete them from the training computer.
…Check WearLink! is displayed and your training computer cannot find your heart rate signal?
• Make sure the heart rate sensor strap has not loosened during exercise.
• Make sure the textile electrodes in sports apparel fit snugly.
• Make sure that the electrodes of the heart rate sensor / sports apparel are moistened.
• Make sure the heart rate sensor / electrodes in the sports apparel are clean and undamaged.
• If the heart rate measurement does not work with the sports apparel, try using a heart rate sensor strap. If
your heart rate is detected with the strap, the problem is most probably in the apparel. Please contact the
apparel retailer / manufacturer.
• If you have done all of the above-mentioned actions, and the message still appears and heart rate
measurement does not work, the battery of your heart rate sensor may be empty. For further information,
see Care and Maintenance (page 60).
…New WearLink found. Teach new WearLink? is displayed?
If you have purchased a new heart rate sensor as an accessory, it will have to be introduced to the training
computer. For further information, see Teach a New Heart Rate Sensor (page ).
If the heart rate sensor you are using is included in the product set, and the text appears on the display,
the training computer may be detecting the signal of another heart rate sensor. In that case, make sure
you are wearing your own heart rate sensor, that the electrodes are moistened, and that the heart rate
sensor strap has not loosened. If the message still appears, the battery of your heart rate sensor is empty.
For further information, see Care and Maintenance (page 60).
...S sensor calibration failed is displayed?*
Calibration did not succeed and you need to re-calibrate. Calibration fails if you move during the process.
Once you reach lap distance, stop running and stand still for calibration. The range of the calibration
factor during manual calibration is 0.500-1.500. If you have defined the calibration factor below or above

1.	Loosen the lock nuts on the feet by hand.
2.	Adjust the feet until the product stands level and
balanced.
3.	Tighten all lock nuts again by hand.

2.5 Connecting to the drain

•	 The end of the drain hose must be directly connected to
the wastewater drain or to the washbasin.

A

warning:

Your house will be flooded if the hose comes
out of its housing during water discharge. Moreover, there
is risk of scalding due to high washing temperatures!
To prevent such situations and to ensure smooth water
intake and discharge of the machine, fix the end of the
discharge hose tightly so that it cannot come out.

•	 The hose should be attached to a height of at least 40
cm, and 100 cm at most.
•	 In case the hose is elevated after laying it on the floor
level or close to the ground (less than 40 cm above the
ground), water discharge becomes more difficult and the
laundry may come out excessively wet. Therefore, follow
the heights described in the figure.

•	 To prevent flowing of dirty water back into the machine
and to allow for easy discharge, do not immerse the hose
end into the dirty water or do not drive it in the drain more
than 15 cm. If it is too long, cut it short.
•	 The end of the hose should not be bent, it should not be
stepped on and the hose must not be pinched between
the drain and the machine.
•	 If the length of the hose is too short, use it by adding
an original extension hose. Length of the hose may
not be longer than 3.2 m. To avoid water leak failures,
the connection between the extension hose and the
drain hose of the product must be fitted well with an
appropriate clamp as not to come off and leak.

2.6 Adjusting the feet

A

warning:

In order to ensure that the product operates
more silently and vibration-free, it must stand level and
balanced on its feet. Balance the machine by adjusting
the feet. Otherwise, the product may move from its place

Adjusting detergent amount
The amount of washing detergent to be used depends
on the amount of laundry, the degree of soiling and water
hardness.
•	 Do not use amounts exceeding the dosage quantities
recommended on the detergent package to avoid
problems of excessive foam, poor rinsing, financial
savings and finally, environmental protection.
•	 Use lesser detergent for small amounts or lightly soiled
clothes.
Using softeners
Pour the softener into the softener compartment of the
detergent drawer.
• 	Do not exceed the (>max<) level marking in the softener
compartment.
• 	If the softener has lost its fluidity, dilute it with water
before putting it in the detergent drawer.
Using liquid detergents
If the product contains a liquid detergent cup:
•	 Make sure that you have placed the liquid detergent cup
in compartment nr. "2".
• 	If the liquid detergent has lost its fluidity, dilute it with
water before putting in the detergent cup.

If the product does not contain a liquid detergent
cup:
•	 Do not use liquid detergent for the prewash in a
programme with prewash.
•	 Liquid detergent stains your clothes when used with
Delayed Start function. If you are going to use the Delayed
Start function, do not use liquid detergent.
Using gel and tablet detergent
Apply the following instructions when using tablet, gel and
similar detergents.
•	 If the gel detergent thickness is fluidal and your machine
does not contain a special liquid detergent cup, put the
gel detergent into the main wash detergent compartment
during first water intake. If your machine contains a liquid
detergent cup, fill the detergent into this cup before
starting the programme.
•	 If the gel detergent thickness is not fluidal or in the shape
of capsule liquid tablet, put it directly into the drum before
washing.
•	 Put tablet detergents into the main wash compartment
(compartment nr. "2") or directly into the drum before
washing.

C
C

Tablet detergents may leave residues in the detergent
compartment. If you encounter such a case, place the
tablet detergent between the laundry, close to the lower
part of the drum in future washings.
Use the tablet or gel detergent without selecting the
prewash function.

Washing Machine / User’s Manual

Using starch
•	 Add liquid starch, powder starch or the fabric dye into the
softener compartment.
•	 Do not use softener and starch together in a washing
cycle.
•	 Wipe the inside of the machine with a damp and clean
cloth after using starch.
Using bleaches
•	 Select a programme with prewash and add the bleaching
agent at the beginning of the prewash. Do not put
detergent in the prewash compartment. As an alternative
application, select a programme with extra rinse and add
the bleaching agent while the machine is taking water
from the detergent compartment during first rinsing step.
•	 Do not use bleaching agent and detergent by mixing
them.

•	 Use just a little amount (approx. 50 ml) of bleaching agent
and rinse the clothes very well as it causes skin irritation.
Do not pour the bleaching agent onto the clothes and do
not use it for coloured clothes.
•	 When using oxygen based bleaches, select a programme
that washes at a lower temperature.
•	 Oxygen based bleaches can be used together with
detergents; however, if its thickness is not the same
with the detergent, put the detergent first into the
compartment nr. "2" in the detergent drawer and wait
until the detergent flows while the machine is taking
in water. Add the bleaching agent from the same
compartment while the machine is still taking in water.
Using limescale remover
• 	When required, use limescale removers manufactured
specifically for washing machines only.

4.4 Main programmes

Programmes are limited with the highest spin speed
appropriate for that particular type of fabric.
When selecting a programme, always consider the type
of fabric, colour, degree of soiling and permissible water
temperature.
Always select the lowest required temperature. Higher
temperature means higher power consumption.
For further programme details, see "Programme and
consumption table"

Depending on the type of fabric, use the following main
programmes.
• Cottons
Use this programme for your cotton laundry (such as bed
sheets, duvet and pillowcase sets, towels, bathrobes,
underwear, etc.). Your laundry will be washed with vigorous
washing action for a longer washing cycle.
• Synthetics
Use this programme to wash your synthetic clothes (shirts,
blouses, synthetic/cotton blends, etc.). It washes with a
gentle action and has a shorter washing cycle compared to
the Cottons programme.
For curtains and tulle, use the Synthetic 40˚C programme
with prewash and anti-creasing functions selected. As their
meshed texture causes excessive foaming, wash the veils/
tulle by putting little amount of detergent into the main
wash compartment. Do not put detergent in the prewash
compartment.
• Woollens
Use this programme to wash your woolen clothes. Select
the appropriate temperature complying with the tags of your
clothes. Use appropriate detergents for woolens.

C
C

An auxiliary function that is not compatible with the
programme cannot be selected. (See “Programme and
consumption table”)
Auxiliary Function buttons may vary according to the
model of the machine.

• Prewash
A Prewash is only worthwhile for heavily soiled laundry. Not
using the Prewash will save energy, water, detergent and
time.

This function can be used in Cottons and Synthetics
programmes. It decreases the washing times and also the
number of rinsing steps for lightly soiled laundry.

C

When you select this function, load your machine with
half of the maximum laundry specified in the programme
table.

• Rinse Plus
This function enables the machine to make another rinsing
in addition to the one already made after the main wash.
Thus, the risk for sensitive skins (babies, allergic skins, etc.)
to be effected by the minimal detergent remnants on the
laundry can be reduced.
• Anti-Creasing
This function creases the clothes lesser when they are being
washed. Drum movement is reduced and spinning speed is
limited to prevent creasing. In addition, washing is done with
a higher water level. Use this function for delicate laundry
that creases easily.

5	 Maintenance and cleaning

Service life of the product extends and frequently faced
problems decrease if cleaned at regular intervals.

5.1 Cleaning the detergent drawer

Clean the detergent drawer at regular intervals (every
4-5 washing cycles) as shown below in order to prevent
accumulation of powder detergent in time.

4.16 Canceling the programme

To cancel the programme, turn the Programme Selection
knob to select another programme. Previous programme
will be canceled. End / Cancel light will flash continuously to
notify that the programme has been canceled.
Your machine will end the programme when you turn the
Programme Selection knob; however, it does not drain the
water inside. When you select and start a new programme,
the newly selected programme will start depending on the
step the previous programme was canceled in. For example,
it may take in additional water or continue to wash with the
water inside.

C

Depending on the step where the programme was
canceled in, you may have to put detergent and softener
again for the programme you have selected anew.

4.17 Your machine is equipped
with a “Standby Mode”

In case of not starting any programme or waiting without
making any other operation when the machine is turned
on by On/Off button and while it is in selection step or if
no other operation is performed approximately 2 minutes
after the programme you selected has come to an end, your
machine will automatically switch to energy saving mode.
Display brightness will decrease. In case of rotating the
Programme Selection knob or pressing any button, lights will
restore to their previous condition. This is not a fault.

1.	Press the dotted point on the siphon in the softener
compartment and pull towards you until the compartment
is removed from the machine.

C

If more than normal amount of water and softener
mixture starts to gather in the softener compartment, the
siphon must be cleaned.

2.	Wash the detergent drawer and the siphon with plenty of
lukewarm water in a washbasin. Wear protective gloves
or use an appropriate brush to avoid touching of the
residues in the drawer with your skin when cleaning.
3.	Insert the drawer back into its place after cleaning and
make sure that it is seated well.
If your detergent drawer is the one indicated in the following
figure:

C

Lift the rear part of the siphon to remove it as illustrated.
After performing the above mentioned cleaning
procedures, replace the siphon back to its seating and
push its front section downwards to make sure that the
locking tab engages.

5.2 Cleaning the loading door and the drum

Residues of softener, detergent and dirt may accumulate
in your machine in time and may cause unpleasant odours
and washing complaints. To avoid this, use the Drum
Cleaning programme. If your machine is not featured with
Drum Cleaning programme, use Cottons-90 programme
and select Additional Water or Extra Rinse auxiliary
functions as well. Run the programme without any laundry in
the machine. Before starting the programme, put max. 100
g of powder anti-limescale into the main wash detergent
compartment (compartment nr. 2). If the anti-limescale is in
tablet form, put only one tablet into compartment nr. 2. Dry
the inside of the bellow with a clean piece of cloth after the
programme has come to an end.

Washing Machine / User’s Manual

C
C

Repeat Drum Cleaning process in every 2 months.
Use an anti-limescale suitable for the washing machines.

After every washing make sure that no foreign substance is
left in the drum.

If the holes on the bellow shown in the figure is blocked,
open the holes using a toothpick.

C
A

Foreign metal substances will cause rust stains in the
drum. Clean the stains on the drum surface by using
cleaning agents for stainless steel. Never use steel wool
or wire wool.
warning:

Never use sponge or scrub materials. These
will damage the painted and plastic surfaces.

5.3 Cleaning the body and control panel

Wipe the body of the machine with soapy water or noncorrosive mild gel detergents as necessary, and dry with a
soft cloth.
Use only a soft and damp cloth to clean the control panel.

5.5 Draining remaining water and
cleaning the pump filter

The filter system in your machine prevents solid items
such as buttons, coins and fabric fibers clogging the pump
impeller during discharge of washing water. Thus, the water
will be discharged without any problem and the service life
of the pump will extend.
If the machine fails to drain water, the pump filter is clogged.
Filter must be cleaned whenever it is clogged or in every 3
months. Water must be drained off first to clean the pump
filter.
In addition, prior to transporting the machine (e.g., when
moving to another house) and in case of freezing of the
water, water may have to be drained completely.

A

warning:

Foreign substances left in the pump filter may
damage your machine or may cause noise problem.

In order to clean the dirty filter and discharge the water:
1.	Unplug the machine to cut off the supply power.

A

warning:

Temperature of the water inside the machine
may rise up to 90 ºC. To avoid burning risk, filter must be
cleaned after the water in the machine cools down.

2.	Open the filter cap.
	 If the filter cap is composed of two pieces, press the
tab on the filter cap downwards and pull the piece out
towards yourself.

5.4 Cleaning the water intake filters

There is a filter at the end of each water intake valve at the
rear of the machine and also at the end of each water intake
hose where they are connected to the tap. These filters
prevent foreign substances and dirt in the water to enter the
washing machine. Filters should be cleaned as they do get
dirty.

1.	Close the taps.
2.	Remove the nuts of the water intake hoses to access
the filters on the water intake valves. Clean them with an
appropriate brush. If the filters are too dirty, take them out
by means of pliers and clean them.
3.	Take out the filters on the flat ends of the water intake
hoses together with the gaskets and clean thoroughly
under running water.
4.	Replace the gaskets and filters carefully in their places
and tighten the hose nuts by hand.

If the filter cap is one piece, pull the cap from both sides at
the top to open.

C

You can remove the filter cover by slightly pushing
downwards with a thin plastic tipped tool, through the
gap above the filter cover. Do not use metal tipped tools
to remove the cover.

some does not have. Follow the steps below to discharge
the water.

Washing Machine / User’s Manual

plug again and fix the hose in its place.
d.	 Turn the pump filter to take it out.
Discharging the water when the product does not have an
emergency draining hose:

a.	 Place a large container in front of the filter to catch water
from the filter.
b.	 Loosen pump filter (anticlockwise) until water starts to
flow. Fill the flowing water into the container you have
placed in front of the filter. Always keep a piece of cloth
handy to absorb any spilled water.
c.	 When the water inside the machine is finished, take out
the filter completely by turning it.
4.	Clean any residues inside the filter as well as fibers, if
any, around the pump impeller region.
5.	Install the filter.
6.	If the filter cap is composed of two pieces, close the filter
cap by pressing on the tab. If it is one piece, seat the tabs
in the lower part into their places first, and then press the
upper part to close.

Network Connection
Network Connection - Wireless
You can connect your TV to your LAN through a standard wireless router or modem. To connect wirelessly, you must first
attach a “Samsung Wireless LAN Adapter” (WIS09ABGN, WIS09ABGN2, WIS10ABGN - sold separately) to either the USB 1
(HDD) or USB 2 port on the side of your TV. See the illustration below.
TV Side Panel

Samsung Wireless
LAN Adapter

LAN Cable

Samsung’s Wireless LAN adapter is sold separately and is offered by select retailers and Ecommerce sites. Samsung’s
Wireless LAN adapter supports the IEEE 802.11a/b/g and n communication protocols. Samsung recommends using IEEE
802.11n. When you play video over a network connection, the video may not be played smoothly.
Most wireless network systems incorporate a security system that requires devices that access the network through an access
point or wireless router (typically a wireless IP Sharer) to transmit an encrypted security code called an access key.
If Pure High-throughput (Greenfield) 802.11n mode is selected and the Encryption type is set to WEP, TKIP or TKIP AES
(WPS2Mixed) for your wireless router, Samsung TVs will not support a connection in compliance with new Wi-Fi certification
specifications.
Network Connection - Wired
There are two main ways to connect your TV to your network using cable, depending on your network setup. They are
illustrated below:

Troubleshooting
If the TV seems to have a problem, first try this list of possible problems and solutions. If none of these troubleshooting tips
apply, visit “www.samsung.com”, then click on Support, or call Samsung customer service centre.
Issues

Solutions and Explanations

The TV will not turn on.

•	 Make sure the AC power cord is securely plugged in to the wall outlet and the TV.
•	 Make sure the wall outlet is working.
•	 Try pressing the POWER button on the TV to make sure the problem is not the remote. If
the TV turns on, refer to “Remote control does not work” below.

There is no picture/video.

•	 Check cable connections (remove and reconnect all cables connected to the TV and
external devices).
•	 Set your external device’s (Cable/Set top Box, DVD, Blu-ray etc) video outputs to match
the connections to the TV input. For example, if an external device’s output is HDMI, it
should be connected to an HDMI input on the TV.
•	 Make sure your connected devices are powered on.
•	 Be sure to select the TV’s correct source by pressing the SOURCE button on the remote
control.
•	 Reboot the connected device by reconnecting the device’s power cable.

The remote control does not work.

•	 Replace the remote control batteries with the poles (+/–) in the right direction.
•	 Clean the sensor’s transmission window on the remote.
•	 Try pointing the remote directly at the TV from 5~6 feet away.

The cable/set top box remote control
doesn’t turn the TV on or off, or
adjust the volume.

•	 Program the Cable/Set top box remote control to operate the TV. Refer to the Cable/Set
user manual for the SAMSUNG TV code.

✎✎You can keep your TV as optimum condition to upgrade the latest firmware on web site (samsung.com -> Support ->
Downloads) by USB.

Securing the TV to the Wall
Caution: Pulling, pushing, or climbing onto the TV may cause the TV to fall. In particular, ensure that your
children do not hang over or destabilize the TV; doing so may cause the TV to tip over, resulting in serious
injuries or death. Follow all safety precautions provided on the included Safety Flyer. For added stability, install
the anti-fall device for safety purposes, as follows.
To avoid the TV from falling
1.	 Put the screws into the clamps and firmly fasten them onto the
wall. Confirm that the screws have been firmly installed onto the
wall.

✎✎ You may need additional material such as an anchor
depending on the type of wall.

✎✎ Since the necessary clamps, screws, and string are not
supplied, please purchase these additionally.

2.	 Remove the screws from the centre back of the TV, put the
screws into the clamps, and then fasten the screws onto the TV
again.

✎✎ Screws may not be supplied with the product. In this case,

please purchase the screws of the following specifications.

✎✎ Screw Specifications

3.	 Connect the clamps fixed onto the TV and the clamps fixed onto
the wall with a strong string and then tie the string tightly.

Wall

✎✎ NOTE

xx Install the TV near to the wall so that it does not fall backwards.
xx It is safe to connect the string so that the clamps fixed on the wall are equal to or lower than the clamps fixed on
the TV.

xx Untie the string before moving the TV.
4.	 Verify all connections are properly secured. Periodically check connections for any sign of fatigue for failure. If you have any
doubt about the security of your connections, contact a professional installer.

To save energy, unplug the charger when not in use. The charger does not have a
power switch, so you must unplug the charger from the electric socket when not in
use to avoid wasting power. The charger should remain close to the electric socket
and easily accessible while charging.

Viewing the remaining charging time
While charging, open the Home screen and tap Apps → Settings → Battery.
The actual charging time may vary depending on the status of your device and the
charging conditions. The remaining charging time may not be displayed when you
charge the device in very cold or very hot conditions.

Reducing the battery consumption
Your device provides various options that help you conserve battery power.
• 	Optimise the device using the Smart manager.
• 	When you are not using the device, switch to sleep mode by pressing the Power key.
• 	Activate power saving mode.
• 	Close unnecessary apps.

Battery charging tips and precautions
• 	When the battery power is low, the battery icon appears empty.
• 	If the battery is completely discharged, the device cannot be turned on immediately
when the charger is connected. Allow a depleted battery to charge for a few minutes
before turning on the device.
• 	If you use multiple apps at once, network apps, or apps that need a connection to
another device, the battery will drain quickly. To avoid disconnecting from the network
or losing power during a data transfer, always use these apps after fully charging the
battery.
• 	Using a power source other than the charger, such as a computer, may result in a slower
charging speed due to a lower electric current.
• 	The device can be used while it is charging, but it may take longer to fully charge the
battery.
• 	If the device receives an unstable power supply while charging, the touchscreen may not
function. If this happens, unplug the charger from the device.
• 	While charging, the device and the charger may heat up. This is normal and should not
affect the device’s lifespan or performance. If the battery gets hotter than usual, the
charger may stop charging.
• 	If the device is not charging properly, take the device and the charger to a Samsung
Service Centre.

Guidelines for safe and efficient use

Please read these simple guidelines. Not following these guidelines may be dangerous
or illegal. Should a fault occur, a software tool is built into your device that will gather
a fault log. This tool gathers only data specific to the fault, such as signal strength, cell
ID position in sudden call drop and applications loaded. The log is used only to help
determine the cause of the fault. These logs are encrypted and can only be accessed
by an authorised LG Repair centre should you need to return your device for repair.

Exposure to radio frequency energy

Radio wave exposure and Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) information.

This mobile phone model LG-D855 has been designed to comply with applicable safety

requirements for exposure to radio waves. These requirements are based on scientific

guidelines that include safety margins designed to assure the safety of all persons,
regardless of age and health.

- The radio wave exposure guidelines employ a unit of measurement known as the
Specific Absorption Rate (SAR). Tests for SAR are conducted using standardised
methods with the phone transmitting at its highest certified power level in all used
frequency bands.

- While there may be differences between the SAR levels of various LG phone models,
they are all designed to meet the relevant guidelines for exposure to radio waves.

- The SAR limit recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing
Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is 2 W/kg averaged over 10g of tissue.

- The highest SAR value for this model phone tested for use at the ear is 0.291 W/kg
(10g) and when worn on the body is 0.269 W/Kg (10 g).

m I

- This device meets RF exposure guidelines when used either in the normal use
position against the ear or when positioned at least 1.5 cm away from the body.
When a carry case, belt clip or holder is used for body-worn operation, it should not
contain metal and should position the product at least 1.5 cm away from your body.
In order to transmit data files or messages, this device requires a quality connection
to the network. In some cases, transmission of data files or messages may be
delayed until such a connection is available. Ensure the above separation distance
instructions are followed until the transmission is completed.

Product care and maintenance

A WARNING

Only use batteries, chargers and accessories approved for use with this
particular phone model. The use of any other types may invalidate any
approval or warranty applying to the phone and may be dangerous.

- Do not disassemble this unit. Take it to a qualified service technician when repair

work is required.

- Repairs under warranty, at LG's discretion, may include replacement parts or boards

that are either new or reconditioned, provided that they have functionality equal to
that of the parts being replaced.

- Keep away from electrical appliances such as TVs, radios and personal computers.
- The unit should be kept away from heat sources such as radiators or cookers.
- Do not drop.

- Do not subject this unit to mechanical vibration or shock.

- Switch off the phone in any area where you are required to by special regulations.

a I

For example, do not use your phone in hospitals as it may affect sensitive medical
equipment.

- Do not handle the phone with wet hands while it is being charged. It may cause an
electric shock and can seriously damage your phone.

- Do not charge a handset near flammable material as the handset can become hot
and create a fire hazard.

- Use a dry cloth to clean the exterior of the unit (do not use solvents such as benzene,
thinner or alcohol).

- Do not charge the phone when it is on soft furnishings.

- The phone should be charged in a well ventilated area.

- Do not subject this unit to excessive smoke or dust.

- Do not keep the phone next to credit cards or transport tickets; it can affect the
information on the magnetic strips.

- Do not tap the screen with a sharp object as it may damage the phone.

- Do not expose the phone to liquid or moisture.

- Use accessories like earphones cautiously. Do not touch the antenna unnecessarily.

- Do not use, touch or attempt to remove or fix broken, chipped or cracked glass.
Damage to the glass display due to abuse or misuse is not covered under the
warranty.

- Your phone is an electronic device that generates heat during normal operation.
Extremely prolonged, direct skin contact in the absence of adequate ventilation may
result in discomfort or minor burns. Therefore, use care when handling your phone
during or immediately after operation.

- If your phone gets wet, immediately unplug it to dry off completely. Do not attempt
to accelerate the drying process with an external heating source, such as an oven,
microwave or hair dryer.

- The liquid in your wet phone, changes the color of the product label inside your
phone. Damage to your device as a result of exposure to liquid is not covered under
your warranty.

\I I

Efficient phone operation

Electronics devices

All mobile phones may receive interference, which could affect performance.

- Do not use your mobile phone near medical equipment without requesting
permission. Avoid placing the phone over pacemakers, for example, in your breast
pocket.

- Some hearing aids might be disturbed by mobile phones.

- Minor interference may affect TVs, radios, PCs etc.

- Use your phone in temperatures between 0°C and 40°C, if possible. Exposing your
phone to extremely low or high temperatures may result in damage, malfunction, or
even explosion.

Road safety

Check the laws and regulations on the use of mobile phones in the area when you

drive.

- Do not use a hand-held phone while driving.

- Give full attention to driving.

- Pull off the road and park before making or answering a call if driving conditions so
require.

- RF energy may affect some electronic systems in your vehicle such as car stereos
and safety equipment.

- When your vehicle is equipped with an air bag, do not obstruct with installed or
portable wireless equipment. It can cause the air bag to fail or cause serious injury
due to improper performance.

- If you are listening to music whilst out and about, please ensure that the volume is
at a reasonable level so that you are aware of your surroundings. This is of particular
importance when near roads.

00 I

Avoid damage to your hearing

To prevent possible hearing damage, do not listen at high volume
levels for long periods.

Damage to your hearing can occur if you are exposed to loud sound for long periods of

time. We therefore recommend that you do not turn on or off the handset close to your

ear. We also recommend that music and call volumes are set to a reasonable level.

- When using headphones, turn the volume down if you cannot hear the people
speaking near you, or if the person sitting next to you can hear what you are listening
to.

NOTE: Excessive sound pressure from earphones and headphones can
cause hearing loss

Glass Parts

Some parts of your mobile device are made of glass. This glass could break if your
mobile device is dropped on a hard surface or receives a substantial impact. If the glass
breaks, do not touch or attempt to remove it. Stop using your mobile device until the
glass is replaced by an authorised service provider.

Blasting area

Do not use the phone where blasting is in progress. Observe restrictions and follow any
regulations or rules.

CO I

Potentially explosive atmospheres

- Do not use your phone at a refueling point.

- Do not use near fuel or chemicals.

- Do not transport or store flammable gas, liquid or explosives in the same
compartment of your vehicle as your mobile phone or accessories.

In aircraft

Wireless devices can cause interference in aircraft.
- Turn your mobile phone off before boarding any aircraft.
- Do not use it on the ground without permission from the crew.

Children

Keep the phone in a safe place out of the reach of small children. It includes small parts
which may cause a choking hazard if detached.

Emergency calls

Emergency calls may not be available on all mobile networks. Therefore you should
never depend solely on your phone for emergency calls. Check with your local service
provider.

Battery information and care

- You do not need to completely discharge the battery before recharging. Unlike other
battery systems, there is no memory effect that could compromise the battery's
performance.

- Use only LG batteries and chargers. LG chargers are designed to maximize the
battery life.

- Do not disassemble or short-circuit the battery.

- Keep the metal contacts of the battery clean.

- Replace the battery when it no longer provides acceptable performance. The battery
pack may be recharged hundreds of times before it needs replacing.

- Recharge the battery if it has not been used for a long time to maximize usability.

- Do not expose the battery charger to direct sunlight or use it in high humidity, such as
in the bathroom.

- Do not leave the battery in hot or cold places, as this may deteriorate battery
performance.

- Risk of explosion if battery is replaced by an incorrect type. Dispose of used batteries
according to the instructions.

- If you need to replace the battery, take it to the nearest authorised LG Electronics
service point or dealer for assistance.

- Always unplug the charger from the wall socket after the phone is fully charged to
save unnecessary power consumption of the charger.

- Actual battery life will depend on network configuration, product settings, usage
patterns, battery and environmental conditions.

- Make sure that no sharp-edged items such as animal's teeth or nails, come into
contact with the battery. This could cause a fire.

Anti-Theft Guide

You can set up your device to prevent other people from using it if it‘s been reset to
factory settings without your permission. For example, if your device is lost, stolen, or
wiped, only someone with your Google account or screen lock information can use the
device.

All you need to make sure your device is protected is:

- Set a screen lock: If your device is lost or stolen but you have a screen lock
set, the device can‘t be erased using the Settings menu unless your screen is
unlocked.

- Add your Google account on your device: If your device is wiped but you have
your Google account on it, the device can‘t finish the setup process until your
Google account information is entered again.

After your device is protected, you‘ll need to either unlock your screen or enter your
Google account password if you need to do a factory reset. This ensures that you or
someone you trust is doing the reset.

NOTE:

- Do not forget your Google account and password you had added to your
device prior to performing a factory reset. If you can't provide the account
information during the setup process, you won't be able to use the device
at all after performing the factory reset.

Answer

. From the Home screen, tap and

Tap Select screen lock > Pattern.

The first time you do this, a short

tutorial about creating an Unlock

Pattern will appear.

You have five chances to enter your

unlock pattern, PIN or password. If you

have used all 5 opportunities, you can
try again after 30 seconds. (Or, if you
preset the backup PIN, you can use
the backup PIN code to unlock the
pattern.)

SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS

ENGLISH
ENG

Do not turn the product On/Off by plugging-in or unplugging the power plug to the
yy
wall outlet. (Do not use the power plug for switch.) y
It may cause mechanical failure or could give an electric shock.
Please follow the installation instructions below to prevent the product from
yy
overheating.
--The distance between the product and the wall should be more than 10 cm.
--Do not install the product in a place with no ventilation (e.g., on a bookshelf or in
a cupboard).
--Do not install the product on a carpet or cushion.
--Make sure the air vent is not blocked by a tablecloth or curtain.
Otherwise, this may result in fire.
Take care not to touch the ventilation openings when watching the TV for long
yy
periods as the ventilation openings may become hot. This does not affect the
operation or performance of the product.
Periodically examine the cord of your appliance, and if its appearance indicates damage or
yy
deterioration, unplug it, discontinue use of the appliance, and have the cord replaced with an exact
replacement part by an authorized servicer.
Prevent dust collecting on the power plug pins or outlet. y
yy
This may cause a fire hazard.
Protect the power cord from physical or mechanical abuse, such as being twisted,
yy
kinked, pinched, closed in a door, or walked upon. Pay particular attention to plugs,
wall outlets, and the point where the cord exits the appliance.
Do not press strongly upon the panel with a hand or sharp object such as nail,
yy
pencil or pen, or make a scratch on it.
Avoid touching the screen or holding your finger(s) against it for long periods of
yy
time. Doing so may produce some temporary distortion effects on the screen.
When cleaning the product and its components, unplug the power first and wipe it
yy
with a soft cloth. Applying excessive force may cause scratches or discolouration.
Do not spray with water or wipe with a wet cloth. Never use glass cleaner, car or
industrial shiner, abrasives or wax, benzene, alcohol etc., which can damage the
product and its panel. y
Otherwise, this may result in fire, electric shock or product damage (deformation,
corrosion or breakage).
As long as this unit is connected to the AC wall outlet, it is not disconnected from the AC power
yy
source even if you turn off this unit by SWITCH.
When unplugging the cable, grab the plug and unplug it. y
yy
If the wires inside the power cable are disconnected, this may cause fire.
When moving the product, make sure you turn the power off first. Then, unplug the
yy
power cables, antenna cables and all connecting cables. y
The TV set or power cord may be damaged, which may create a fire hazard or
cause electric shock.

SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS

Contact the service center once a year to clean the internal parts of the product. y
yy
Accumulated dust can cause mechanical failure.
Refer all servicing to qualified service personnel. Servicing is required when the
yy
apparatus has been damaged in any way, such as power supply cord or plug is
damaged, liquid has been spilled or objects have fallen into the apparatus, the
apparatus has been exposed to rain or moisture, does not operate normally, or has
been dropped.
If the product feels cold to the touch, there may be a small “flicker” when it is turned
yy
on. This is normal, there is nothing wrong with product.
The panel is a high technology TFT product with resolution of two million to six
yy
million pixels. You may see tiny black dots and/or brightly coloured dots (red, blue
or green) at a size of 1 ppm on the panel. This does not indicate a malfunction and
does not affect the performance and reliability of the product.  y
This phenomenon also occurs in third-party products and is not subject to
exchange or refund.
You may find different brightness and colour of the panel depending on your
yy
viewing position(left/right/top/down). y
This phenomenon occurs due to the characteristic of the panel. It is not related with
the product performance, and it is not malfunction.

Displaying a still image (e.g., broadcasting channel logo, on-screen menu, scene from a video
yy
game) for a prolonged time may cause damage to the screen, resulting in retention of the image,
which is known as image sticking. The warranty does not cover the product for image sticking. y
Avoid displaying a fixed image on your television’s screen for a prolonged period (2 or more hours
for LCD, 1 or more hours for Plasma). y
Also, if you watch the TV at a ratio of 4:3 for a long time, image sticking may occur on the borders of
the panel. y
This phenomenon also occurs in third-party products and is not subject to exchange or refund.
yyGenerated Sound
“Cracking” noise: A cracking noise that occurs when watching or turning off the TV is generated by
plastic thermal contraction due to tempera-ture and humidity. This noise is common for products
where thermal deformation is required. Electrical circuit humming/panel buzzing: A low level noise is
generated from a high-speed switching circuit, which supplies a large amount of current to operate a
product. It varies depend-ing on the product. y
This generated sound does not affect the performance and reliability of the product.

ENGLISH

heavy. y
Otherwise, this may result in injury.

Viewing 3D Imaging (Only 3D models)

WARNING
Viewing Environment
yy Viewing Time
-- When watching 3D contents, take 5 - 15 minute breaks every hour. Viewing 3D contents for a long
period of time may cause headache, dizziness, fatigue or eye strain.
Those that have a photosensitive seizure or chronic illness
yy Some users may experience a seizure or other abnormal symptoms when they are exposed to a
flashing light or particular pattern from 3D contents.
yy Do not watch 3D videos if you feel nausea, are pregnant and/ or have a chronic illness such as epilepsy,
cardiac disorder, or blood pressure disease, etc.
yy 3D Contents are not recommended to those who suffer from stereo blindness or stereo anomaly. Double
images or discomfort in viewing may be experienced.
yy If you have strabismus (cross-eyed), amblyopia (weak eyesight) or astigmatism, you may have trouble
sensing depth and easily feel fatigue due to double images. It is advised to take frequent breaks than
the average adult.
yy If your eyesight varies between your right and left eye, revise your eyesight prior to watching 3D
contents.
Symptoms which require discontinuation or refraining from watching 3D contents
yy Do not watch 3D contents when you feel fatigue from lack of sleep, overwork or drinking.
yy When these symptoms are experienced, stop using/watching 3D contents and get enough rest until the
symptom subsides.
-- Consult your doctor when the symptoms persist. Symptoms may include headache, eyeball pain,
dizziness, nausea, palpitation, blurriness, discomfort, double image, visual inconvenience or fatigue.

SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS

11

Viewing Environment
�	 Viewing Distance
-	 Maintain a distance of at least twice the screen diagonal length when watching 3D contents. If you
feel discomfort in viewing 3D contents, move further away from the TV.
Viewing Age
yy Infants/Children
-- Usage/ Viewing 3D contents for children under the age of 5 are prohibited.
-- Children under the age of 10 may overreact and become overly excited because their vision is in
development (for example: trying to touch the screen or trying to jump into it. Special monitoring
and extra attention is required for children watching 3D contents.
-- Children have greater binocular disparity of 3D presentations than adults because the distance
between the eyes is shorter than one of adults. Therefore they will perceive more stereoscopic
depth compared to adults for the same 3D image.
yy Teenagers
-- Teenagers under the age of 19 may react with sensitivity due to stimulation from light in 3D
contents. Advise them to refrain from watching 3D contens for a long time when they are tired.
yy Elderly
-- The elderly may perceive less 3D effect compared to the youth. Do not sit closer to the TV than the
recommended distance.
Cautions when using the 3D glasses
�	 Make sure to use LG 3D glasses. Otherwise, you may not be able to view 3D videos properly.
�	 Do not use 3D glasses instead of your normal glasses, sunglasses or protective goggles.
�	 Using modified 3D glasses may cause eye strain or image distortion.
�	 Do not keep your 3D glasses in extremely high or low temperatures. It will cause deformation.
�	 The 3D glasses are fragile and are easy to be scratched. Always use a soft, clean piece of cloth when
wiping the lenses. Do not scratch the lenses of the 3D glasses with sharp objects or clean/wipe them
with chemicals.

After 60 seconds if no pan is placed on the zone, the system stops “searching” pots on that zone, the symbol
is disabled.
To reactivate the Flexicook function, press one of the 2 buttons

EN8

remains visible on the display to remind that the zone

The Flexi cook function is also able to detect when a pot is moved from one zone to the other one within the flexi cook area keeping the same power level of the zone
where the pan originally was placed (see the example in the figure below: if the pot is moved from the front heater to the rear heater, the power level will be shown
on the display corresponding to the zone where the pot is placed).
It is also possible to operate the Flexi cook area as two independent cooking zones, using the corresponding button of the single zone. Place the pot in the center of the
single zone and adjust the power level with the slide touchscreen.

i Important: make sure to place the pans centered on the cooking zone in the way to cover the center of the single cooking zone.
In case of big pot, oval, rectangular and elongated pans make sure to place the pans centered on the cooking zone.

CLEANING
WARNING

-

Do not use steam cleaners.
Before cleaning, make sure the cooking zones are switched off and that the residual heat indicator (“H”)
is not displayed.

If your glass has the iXeliumTM logo, your hob is equipped with iXeliumTM treatment. iXeliumTM is the exclusive Whirlpool finishing that guarantees a perfect clean and
a long-lasting brilliance. Therefore, if you have a IXELIUM hob, we strongly suggest to observe the following cleaning recommendations:
• Use a soft cloth (microfibre is best) dampened with water or with everyday glass cleaning detergent.
• If you want to enhance furtherly cleaning results, just let the glass in contact with a wet cloth for couple of minutes.
IMPORTANT: Do not use abrasive sponges or scouring pads. Their use could eventually ruin the glass.
• After each use, clean the hob (when it is cool) to remove any deposits and stains due to food residuals.
• Sugar or foods with a high sugar content damage the hob and must be immediately removed.
• Salt, sugar and sand could scratch the glass surface.
• Use a soft cloth, absorbent kitchen paper or a specific hob cleaner (follow the Manufacturer’s instructions).
• Liquid splillages on the cooking zones may make pan vibrate or move
• Dry the hob thoroughly after cleaning it.

NOISES MADE BY THE HOB
Induction hobs can make whistling or crackling sounds during normal operation, these actually come from the pots and pans as a result of the characteristics of the
bottoms (for example, bottoms made of several layers of material, or uneven bottoms). These noises vary depending on the pots and pans used and the amount of food
they contain, and are not indicative of a defect of any kind.
In addition, the induction hob is equipped with an internal cooling system to control the temperature of electronic parts; as a result, during operation and for several
minutes after the hob has been switched off, the noise of the cooling fan will be audible. This is perfectly normal and indeed essential for proper functioning of the
appliance.

AFTER-SALES SERVICE
Before contacting the After-sales Service:
1. See if you can solve the problem yourself with the help of the “Troubleshooting guide”.
2. Switch the appliance off and then on again it to see if the problem has been eliminated.
If the problem persists after the above checks, contact the nearest After-Sales Service.
Always specify:
• a brief description of the fault;
• the product type and exact model;
• the Service number (the number after the word Service on the rating plate), located under the appliance (on the metal plate).
• your full address;
• your telephone number.

If any repairs are required, contact an authorised After-Sales Service Centre (to ensure the use of original spare parts and correct repairs). Spare parts are available
for 10 years.
