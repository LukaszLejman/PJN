3D FUNCTION
3D technology uses different video frames for each eye to add depth to the
video.
While Watching 3D
WARNING
If you view 3D video or images too closely for a long period of time, you
may experience eyestrain.
If you watch the projector or game screen for a long time with 3D
glasses on, you may experience dizziness or eye fatigue.
People with chronic diseases (epilepsy, cardiovascular disease, blood
pressure-related diseases, etc.
), pregnant women, and people with
serious motion sickness should avoid watching 3D video.


People with stereo blindness, or with stereopsis problems, should also
avoid watching 3D video contentIt may cause double vision or visual ~~~ discomfort.
People with strabismus, amblyopia, or astigmatism may have difficulty
perceiving video depth and may be fatigued easily due to double vision
or other ailmentsIt is recommended to rest more frequently than other ~~~ viewers.
Because 3D can be perceived as real, some viewers may be surprised

or overexcited.
Do not watch 3D images near fragile objects or any objects that can be
knocked over easily.
Take care not to injure yourself as you may subconsciously try to move
away from the life-like 3D images.
3D FUNCTION

Warning about photosensitivity seizures
--Some users may experience a seizure or other abnormal symptoms
when they are exposed to a flashing light or particular patterns from
a video gameIf anyone in your family has a history of epilepsy or
has ever experienced any kind of seizure, please consult your doctor ~~~ before viewing 3D images.
If you experience one of the following symptoms while watching a 3D
video, stop watching the 3D video immediately and take a rest.
--Dizziness, switched eyesight, twitching of the eye or facial muscles,
involuntary movements, cramp, loss of consciousness, confusion,
loss of sense of direction, or nauseaIf the symptom does not
disappear, please consult your doctor.
You can reduce the risk of photosensitive seizures by taking the
following preventive measures.
--Take a rest of 5 to 15 minsfor every 1 hour of viewing.
--If vision varies between each eye, correct the variation before
beginning to watch a 3D video.
--Ensure that the 3D video is directly in front of you, at eye level.
--You should stop watching if you experience a headache, fatigue, or
dizziness.
--Do not view 3D images for a long period of time when you are tired
or ill.
CAUTION
Extra special care is required for children watching a 3D video.
70
3D FUNCTION
When Watching 3D Video
Prevent children of 5 years or younger from watching a 3D videoIt may
impair the development of their eyes.
Children 10 years old or younger are still developing their eyesight and
may have an excessive tendency to touch or jump at the screenAdult
guidance and supervision is recommended.
Since the distance between the eyes is narrower for children than in
adults, children tend to notice a greater difference in the images seen by
each eyeTherefore, even while watching the same 3D video, children
may have a greater depth perception than adults.
Children under 19 years old or younger may respond with sensitivity to
the light stimuli of 3D contentExcessive viewing when fatigued is not ~~~ recommended.
Elderly viewers may have a reduced depth perception than younger
viewersAvoid watching video nearer than the recommended distance.
Watch 3D images within the optimum viewing angle and distance.
If you are outside the viewing angle or distance, you may not be able to
see 3D imagesYou cannot view 3D images when you are lying down.
You may see left and right images overlapped during projector
initialization after it is powered onIt may take some time for
optimization.
It may take some time for the 3D image to look normal after you turn
your eyes away from the screen and look back at the 3D image.

It may flicker slightly while watching 3D images under a 3 wavelength
lamp fluorescent light (50 Hz to 60 Hz) or near windowsIf so, it is
recommended to block the sun light with a curtain and to dim the lights.

The 3D glasses must be DLP-LINK (DLP Ready) type.
You may not be able to watch 3D properly if there is an obstacle
between the projector and 3D glasses.
Install the 3D projector as far as possible from other devices.
If a future 3D broadcasting format that is not supported by this projector
becomes the standard, an additional device such as a set-top box may
be required.
3D FUNCTION

Please check the following when using 3D glasses.
Do not use 3D glasses as ordinary glasses, sunglasses, or protective ~~~ goggles.
--If you do so, this may cause injury.
Do not store 3D glasses in very hot or very cold conditionsIf you do,
this may cause them to become distortedDo not use distorted glasses.
Do not drop 3D glasses or allow them to come into contact with other ~~~ objects.
--This may cause product malfunction.
The lenses of 3D glasses are easily scratchedUse a soft clean cloth
when cleaning them.
Foreign particles on the cloth may cause scratches.
Do not scratch the surface of the 3D glasses' lenses with sharp objects
or wipe them with chemicalsIf the lenses get scratched, images may
not look normal when viewing 3D.

Requirements for Watching 3D Images
Optimum viewing angle: Top/Bottom/Left/Right 9°
Recommended viewing distance: 3 m
Recommended screen size: 101 cm
￼
Watching 3D videos should be done in dark room environments only.
NOTE
The pairing with the DLP-LINK glasses is affected by the intensity of
light reflected from the screenTherefore, the pairing with DLP-LINK
glasses may not work properly if the light reflected from the screen is
not bright enough, such as when the surrounding area is bright, the
screen is big, or the maximum energy saving mode is enabled.
Some menus may not work while playing a 3D video.
You can only watch a 3D video properly when the 3D video format
option has been selected on the projector.

on the display corresponding to the zone where the pot is placed).
It is also possible to operate the Flexi cook area as two independent cooking zones, using the corresponding button of the single zonePlace the pot in the center of the
single zone and adjust the power level with the slide touchscreen.
i Important: make sure to place the pans centered on the cooking zone in the way to cover the center of the single cooking zone.

Do not use steam cleaners.
Before cleaning, make sure the cooking zones are switched off and that the residual heat indicator (“H”) ~~~ is not displayed.
If your glass has the iXeliumTM logo, your hob is equipped with iXeliumTM treatmentiXeliumTM is the exclusive Whirlpool finishing that guarantees a perfect clean and
a long-lasting brillianceTherefore, if you have a IXELIUM hob, we strongly suggest to observe the following cleaning recommendations:
Use a soft cloth (microfibre is best) dampened with water or with everyday glass cleaning detergent.
If you want to enhance furtherly cleaning results, just let the glass in contact with a wet cloth for couple of minutes.
IMPORTANT: Do not use abrasive sponges or scouring padsTheir use could eventually ruin the glass.
After each use, clean the hob (when it is cool) to remove any deposits and stains due to food residuals.
Sugar or foods with a high sugar content damage the hob and must be immediately removed.
Salt, sugar and sand could scratch the glass surface.
Use a soft cloth, absorbent kitchen paper or a specific hob cleaner (follow the Manufacturer’s instructions).
Liquid splillages on the cooking zones may make pan vibrate or move
Dry the hob thoroughly after cleaning it.

NOISES MADE BY THE HOB
Induction hobs can make whistling or crackling sounds during normal operation, these actually come from the pots and pans as a result of the characteristics of the
bottoms (for example, bottoms made of several layers of material, or uneven bottoms)These noises vary depending on the pots and pans used and the amount of food
they contain, and are not indicative of a defect of any kind.
In addition, the induction hob is equipped with an internal cooling system to control the temperature of electronic parts; as a result, during operation and for several
minutes after the hob has been switched off, the noise of the cooling fan will be audibleThis is perfectly normal and indeed essential for proper functioning of the ~~~ appliance.

Product Features
Inverter Direct Drive system
The advanced Brushless DC motor directly drives the drum without
belt and pulley.
6 Motion
Washer is able to perform various drum actions or a combination of
different actions depending on the wash program selected.
Combined with a controlled spin speed and the ability of the drum to
rotate both left and right, the wash performance of the machine is greatly
improved, giving you perfect results every time.
Protection against creases
With the alternating rotation of the drum, creasing is minimized.
Built-in heater
Internal heater automatically heats the water to the best temperature
on selected cycles.
More economical with Intelligent Wash system
Intelligent Wash System detects the size of load and water temperature,
and then determines the optimum water level and washing time to
minimize energy and water consumption.
Child Lock
The Child Lock prevents children from pressing any button to change
the settings during operation.
Low noise speed control system
By sensing the amount of load and balance, it evenly distributes load
to minimize the spinning noise level.

cause heavy load to the motor.
It is recommended that you use powdered detergent for best results.
If you wish to use liquid detergent follow guidelines provided by the detergent manufacturer.
You can pour liquid detergent directly into the main detergent drawer if you are starting the cycle
immediately.
Please do not use liquid detergent if you are using ‘Time Delay’ as the liquid may harden, or if you
have selected ‘Pre Wash’.
If too many suds occur, please reduce the detergent amount.
Detergent usage may need to be adjusted for water temperature, water hardness, size and soil level
of the loadFor best results, avoid oversudsing.
Refer to the label of the clothes, before choose the detergent and water temperature.
To use the washing machine, put the designated detergent only.
- General powdered detergents for all types of fabric (Cold - 95°C)
- Powdered detergents for delicate fabric (Cold - 40°C)
- Liquid detergents for all types of fabric (Cold - 95°C) or designated detergents only for wool
(Cold - 40°C)
For better washing performance and whitening, use the detergent with the General powdered bleach.

WARNING
Do not let the detergent harden.
Doing so may lead to blockages, poor rinse performance or bad odor.

Troubleshooting guide
NOTE
SMARTDIAGNOSIS™ function is available only for the products with a SMARTDIAGNOSIS™ mark.
In case of a mobile phone with static option, the SMARTDIAGNOSIS™ function might not operate.
 Using SMARTDIAGNOSIS™
Only use this feature when instructed to do so by the call center.
The transmission sounds similar to a fax machine, and so has no meaning except to the call center.
SMARTDIAGNOSIS™ cannot be activated if the washer does not power up.
If this happens, then troubleshooting must be done without SMARTDIAGNOSIS™.
If you experience problems with your washer, call to Customer Information Center.
Follow the call center agent's instructions, and do the following steps when requested:
1Press the Power button to turn on the washerDo not press any
other buttons or turn the cycle selector knob.
2When instructed to do so by the call center, place the mouthpiece
of your phone very close to the Power button.
Max10 mm
3Touch and hold the “Temp.” button for three seconds, while holding the phone mouthpiece to the icon or
Power button.
4Keep the phone in place until the tone transmission has finished.
This takes about 6 seconds, and the display will count down the time.
For best results, do not move the phone while the tones are being transmitted.
If the call center agent is not able to get an accurate recording of the data, you may be asked to try
again.
Pressing the Power button during the transmission will shut off the SMARTDIAGNOSIS™.
5Once the countdown is over and the tones have stopped, resume your conversation with the call center
agent, who will then be able to assist you using the information transmitted for analysis at the call to
Customer information center.
Smart Diagnosis is a troubleshooting feature designed to assist, not replace, the traditional method of
troubleshooting through service callsThe effectiveness of this feature depends upon various factors,
including, but not limited to, the reception of the cellular phone being used for transmission, any external
noise that may be present during the transmission, and the acoustics of the room where the machine is
located. ~~~ Accordingly, LG does not guarantee that Smart Diagnosis would accurately troubleshoot any given issue.

Viewing Environment
yy Viewing Time
-- When watching 3D contents, take 5 - 15 minute breaks every hourViewing 3D contents for a long
period of time may cause headache, dizziness, fatigue or eye strain.
Viewing Age
yy Infants/Children
-- Usage/ Viewing 3D contents for children under the age of 6 are prohibited.
-- Children under the age of 10 may overreact and become overly excited because their vision is in
development (for example: trying to touch the screen or trying to jump into itSpecial monitoring
and extra attention is required for children watching 3D contents.
- Children have greater binocular disparity of 3D presentations than adults because the distance
between the eyes is shorter than one of adultsTherefore they will perceive more stereoscopic
depth compared to adults for the same 3D image.
y ~~~ Teenagers
y ~~~ -- Teenagers under the age of 19 may react with sensitivity due to stimulation from light in 3D
contentsAdvise them to refrain from watching 3D contens for a long time when they are tired.
y ~~~ Elderly ~~~ y
-- The elderly may perceive less 3D effect compared to the youthDo not sit closer to the TV than the
recommended distance.
Those that have a photosensitive seizure or chronic illness
yy Some users may experience a seizure or other abnormal symptoms when they are exposed to a
flashing light or particular pattern from 3D contents.
yy Do not watch 3D videos if you feel nausea, are pregnant and/ or have a chronic illness such as epilepsy,
cardiac disorder, or blood pressure disease, etc.
yy 3D Contents are not recommended to those who suffer from stereo blindness or stereo anomaly.
Double images or discomfort in viewing may be experienced.
yy If you have strabismus (cross-eyed), amblyopia (weak eyesight) or astigmatism, you may have trouble
sensing depth and easily feel fatigue due to double imagesIt is advised to take frequent breaks than
the average adult.

channel numberThe Physical number is the actual
digital channel number, the Major is the number that
the channel should be mapped to, and the Minor is

the sub-channelSince the ATSC tuner automatically
maps the channel from the Major / Minor number,
the Physical number is not required when sending a

Digital channels have a Physical, Major, and Minor
channel numberThe Physical number is the actual
digital channel number, the Major is the number that
the channel should be mapped to, and the Minor is
the sub-channelSince the ATSC tuner automatically
maps the channel from the Major / Minor number,
the Physical number is not required when sending a
command in Digital.

Calibrate the Polar s3/s3+ Stride Sensor W.I.N.D.
Optional calibration of the s3/s3+ sensor improves accuracy of speed, pace, and distance measurements.
It is recommended that you calibrate the sensor before using it for the first time, if there are significant
changes in your running style, or if the position of the sensor on the shoe is dramatically changed (e.gif
you have new running shoes)You can calibrate the sensor by running a known distance, or by setting the
calibration factor manually.
You can calibrate one s3/s3+ sensor for each shoe setting.
Calibrate Sensor by Running a Distance (on-the-fly calibration)
You can calibrate the sensor at any phase of your exercise with lap distance correction, provided you are
not exercising with distance-based targetsJust run a known distance, preferably more than 1000 meters.
Make sure the sensor function in the training computer is on (Settings > Features > Shoes/bikes > Shoes
1/2/3 > On).
In time mode press OK onceSelect Settings > Shoes/bikes > Shoes 1/2/3.
Then select Start and start running.
When you are in a starting point of a known lap distance, press OKWhen you have run the whole lap
distance, press OKThen calibrate the sensor by choosing either alternative:
1.
Press and hold LIGHT to go to SettingsOr,
2.
Press STOP onceSelect Settings.
Select Calibrate > Correct lap > Set true lap distanceFix the displayed lap distance with the distance
you just ran, and press OK.
Calibration complete and the factor are displayedThe sensor is now calibrated and ready for action.
Set Calibration Factor Manually
The calibration factor is calculated as a ratio of the actual distance to the uncalibrated distanceExample:
you run 1200m, the training computer shows a distance of 1180m, the calibration factor is 1.000.
Calculate the new calibration factor as follows: 1.0001200/1180 = 1.017The measuring range for the
factor is 0.500-1.500.
There are four options for setting the calibration factor:
1.
Before exercise.
Select Settings > Features > Shoes/bikes > Shoe 1/2/3 > Calibrate
Set the Calibration factor and press OKThe sensor is now calibrated.
2.
During exercise by pausing exercise recording.
Start exercising by pressing OK twice in the time displayPress STOP once and the exercise recording is ~~~ paused.
Select Settings > Calibrate > Set factor
Set the Calibration factor and press OKThe sensor is now calibratedContinue exercise recording by

Method 2
Measure the wheel manually for the most accurate result.
Use the valve to mark the point where the wheel touches the groundDraw a line on the ground to mark
that pointMove your bike forward on a flat surface for one complete rotationThe tire should be
perpendicular to the groundDraw another line on the ground at the valve to mark a full rotationMeasure
the distance between the two lines.
Subtract 4 mm to account for your weight on the bike to get your wheel circumferenceEnter this value in ~~~ the cycling computer.

Altitude
The training computer converts measured air pressure into an altitude readingChange the settings of the
altimeter in the Altitude menuYou can calibrate the altimeter manually or automatically.
Set the altitude function on or off
Select Settings > Features > Altitude > On / Off
Calibrating the Altitude Manually
Select Settings > Features > Altitude > Calibrate > set the altitude of current location
If the altitude of your location differs significantly from the displayed altitude value Calibrate to xx?
is
displayed.
Yes: Altitude calibrated to xx is displayed.
No: Altitude calibration canceled is displayedThe last altitude value stored in the training computer’s
memory is applied.
Calibrate the altitude to ensure it remains accurateSet the reference altitude whenever a reliable
reference, such as a peak or a topographic map, is available or when at sea level.
Calibrating the Altitude Automatically
Select Settings > Features > Altitude > AutoCalib > On / Off
When automatic calibration is on, the last altitude value stored in the training computer’s memory is
applied when exercisingThis feature is especially useful if you always start a session in the same
environmentIf automatic calibration fails, you are not in the usual environment and will need to calibrate
the altitude manually.
Altitude calibrated to xx m/ft indicates that calibration has succeededIf Altitude calibration failed is
displayed, re-calibrate the altitude.
Recording Rate
Select Settings > Features > Rec.rate > 1 / 2 / 5 / 15 / 60 sec

The training computer can store your heart rate, speed/pace, and altitude in 1, 2, 5, 15 or 60 second
intervalsA longer interval gives you more recording time, while a shorter interval allows you to record
more heart and other dataThis enables accurate data analysis using the software.
A shorter recording rate consumes the memory of the training computer more rapidlyThe remaining
recording time is displayed on the lower row when setting the rateDefault recording rate is 5 seconds.
When less than 30 minutes of maximum recording time is left, the recording rate changes automatically to
longer recording time (1s > 2s > 5s > 15s > 60s)This will maximize the time to record exercise data.
When the session ends, the current recording rate remains as default.
The following table shows the maximum recording times for each recording rateNote that recording rate
might change when there is less than 30 minutes of recording time left.

This is a sum of 2 or more exercises; maximum duration of a single exercise is 99 h 59 min 59 sThe
maximum recording time can be shorter, if you record a large number of short exercises.
The durations in the table are estimatesFor RR data, maximum recording time depends on heart rate and
variation of heart rateIf you record laps in your exercise, and/or if you have created an exercise that includes
phases with the software, the maximum recording time will decrease.
Recording doesn't automatically stop when the memory becomes fullTherefore, exercise time may be
longer than recording time.
RR Data Function
Select Settings > Features > RR data > On / Off
The RR data recording function measures and records heartbeat variations within one millisecond
resolutionThis enables the analysis (accuracy 1ms) of heart rate variability (HRV) using the softwareThe
RR data function consumes the memory of the training computer, therefore when setting the function, the
remaining recording time is shown on the lower row of the display.

High: You participate at least 3 times a week in heavy physical exercise, e.gyou run 20-50 km/12-31
miles per week or spend 3-5 hours per week in comparable physical activity.
Moderate: You participate regularly in recreational sports, e.gyou run 5-10 km or 3-6 miles per week or
spend 1/2-2 hours per week in comparable physical activity, or your work requires modest physical ~~~ activity.
Low: You do not participate regularly in programmed recreational sport or heavy physical activity, e.gyou
walk only for pleasure or exercise hard enough to cause heavy breathing or perspiration only occasionally.
In the training computer, these values are used to calculate your energy expenditure.
Heart Rate: HRmax, HRsit

HRmax (Maximum heart rate): Your age-predicted HR max value (220 - age) is used as a defaultSet your
HRmax manually if your maximum heart rate has been determined in a lab, or if you have tested your
maximum heart rate in the field yourself.
HRsit (Heart rate value in a sitting position): Set your HRsit value if you have determined it according to
the instructionsFor instructions, see Heart Rate Value in a Sitting Position (page 55).
Maximal Oxygen Intake: VO2max
VO2max is your body’s maximum capacity for oxygen consumption during maximum exertionThe most
accurate way of determining VO2max is to perform a maximal stress test in a laboratoryIf you know your
exact clinically-tested VO2max, set the value in the training computerOtherwise, measure a comparable
value, OwnIndex, by taking the Polar Fitness TestFor further information, see Polar Fitness Test TM

Polar Fitness Test TM
The Polar Fitness Test TM is an easy, safe, and quick way to measure your aerobic (cardiovascular) fitness
at restThe result, Polar OwnIndex, is comparable to maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), which is commonly
used to evaluate aerobic fitnessYour long-term level of physical activity, heart rate, heart rate variability
at rest, gender, age, height, and body weight all influence OwnIndexThe Polar Fitness Test is developed
for use by healthy adults.
Aerobic fitness relates to how well your cardiovascular system works to transport oxygen to your bodyThe
better your aerobic fitness, the stronger and more efficient your heart isGood aerobic fitness has many
health benefitsFor example, it helps in decreasing high blood pressure and your risk of cardiovascular
diseases and strokeIf you want to improve your aerobic fitness it takes, on average, six weeks of regular
training to see a noticeable change in your OwnIndexLess fit individuals see progress even more rapidly.
The better your aerobic fitness, the smaller the improvements in your OwnIndex.

Aerobic fitness is best improved by exercise types that use large muscle groupsSuch activities include
running, cycling, walking, rowing, swimming, skating, and cross-country skiing.
To monitor your progress, start by measuring your OwnIndex a couple of times during the first two weeks
in order to get a baseline value, and then repeat the test approximately once a month.
With the Polar Fitness Test, you can also calculate the predicted maximum heart rate value (HR max-p)The
HRmax-p score predicts your individual maximum heart rate more accurately than the age-based formula
(220 - age)For further information on HRmax, see User Settings (page 37).
To make sure the test results are reliable, the following basic requirements apply:
You can perform the test anywhere - at home, at the office, at a health club - provided the testing
environment is peacefulThere should be no disturbing noises (e.gtelevision, radio, or telephone) and no
other people talking to you.
Always take the test in the same environment and at the same hour.
Avoid eating a heavy meal or smoking 2-3 hours prior to testing.
Avoid heavy physical exertion, alcohol, and pharmacological stimulants on the test day and the previous ~~~ day.
You should be relaxed and calmLie down and relax for 1-3 minutes before starting the test.

Polar OwnOptimizerTM
General
Successful training requires temporary overloading: longer exercise duration, higher intensity, or higher
total volumeIn order to avoid severe overtraining, overloading must always be followed by an adequate
recovery periodWith an inadequate recovery period, you may experience a decrease in performance as a
result of high training volumes, instead of improvementPolar OwnOptimizer is an easy and reliable way to
determine whether your training program is optimally developing your performancePolar OwnOptimizer is
developed for use by healthy adults.
Polar OwnOptimizer is a modification of a traditional orthostatic overtraining testIt is a perfect tool,
embedded in the training computer, for everyone training regularly, at least three times a week, for fitness
improvement or to reach competitive targetsThis feature is based on heart rate and heart rate variability
measurements taken during an orthostatic test (standing up from relaxed resting)OwnOptimizer helps you
to optimize your training load during a training program so that you experience an increase in performance
and do not undertrain or overtrain in the long runPolar OwnOptimizer is based on regular long-term
measurements of five heart rate parametersTwo of these five values are calculated at rest, one while
standing up, and two while standingEach time you perform the test, the wrist unit saves the heart rate
values and compares them to the previous values registered.
Before the Test
Baseline Tests
When you use OwnOptimizer for the first time, six baseline tests should be conducted over a period of two
weeks to determine your personal baseline valueThese baseline measurements should be taken during
two typical basic training weeks, not during heavy training weeksThe baseline measurements should
include tests taken after a training day and after recovery days.
Monitoring OwnOptimizer Values
After the baseline recordings, you should continue to perform the test 2-3 times a weekTest yourself
weekly in the morning following both a recovery day and a heavy training day (or a series of heavy training
days)An optional third test can be performed after a normal training dayOwnOptimizer may not provide
reliable information during detraining or in a very irregular training periodIf you take a break from
exercise for 14 days or longer, the baseline tests should be performed again.
Performing the Test
The test should always be taken in standardized/similar conditions in order to get the most reliable results.
It is recommended that you take the test in the morning before breakfastThe following basic
requirements apply: ~~~ Wear the heart rate sensor.
You should be relaxed and calm.
You can be seated in a relaxed position or lying in bedThe position should always be the same when you
do the test.
The test can take place anywhere – at home, in the office, at a health club – as long as the test
environment is peacefulThere should be no disturbing noises (for example, television, radio or telephone)
or other people talking to you.
Avoid eating, drinking and smoking 2-3 hours prior to the test.

A numerical and written interpretation of the result is displayedPress DOWN to see your average heart
rate (bpm) while lying down (HRrest), the highest heart rate while standing up (HRpeak ), and the average
heart rate while standing (HRstand).
You can interrupt the test in any phase by pressing STOPOptimizer Test canceled is displayed.
If the training computer cannot receive your heart rate signal, the message Test failedCheck WearLink is
displayedIn which case, you should check that the heart rate sensor electrodes are wet and that the
textile strap fits snugly.
After the Test
How to Interpret Results
The wrist unit calculates five heart rate and heart rate variability based parametersThe OwnOptimizer
values are calculated by comparing your latest results to previous onesThe wrist unit will display a
written description of your training statusThe descriptions are defined in detail below.
Good Recovery (1)
Your heart rate is lower than averageThis indicates that you have recovered very wellYou can continue
training, including intensive exercise sessions.
Normal State (2)
Your heart rate is at a normal levelGo on with your training; include both light and intensive training
sessions, and recovery days.
Training Effect (3)
Your heart rate is higher than averageYou may have exercised intensively in the previous daysYou have
two choices: 1) rest or train lightly for one or two days, or 2) continue intensive training for one or two
days and then recover wellOther sources of stress such as the beginning of a fever or an attack of the flu
can result in the same kind of response.
Steady State (4)
Your heart rate has continuously been at a normal level for a long time nowEffective training requires
both heavy training and good recovery, and this should cause variation in your heart rate resultsYour
OwnOptimizer result indicates that you have not had very intensive training or good recovery for a while.
Perform the test again after a rest or light training dayIf the recovery is effective, your result should show
Good recovery.
Stagnant State (5)
Your heart rate is still at a normal level, and this has continued for a long timeThe result indicates that
your training has not been intensive enough to develop optimallyTo improve your condition effectively,
you should now include more intense or longer exercise sessions in your program.
Hard Training (6)
Your heart rate has been higher than average several timesYou may have trained hard on purposeThe
result indicates overloading, and you should try to recover well nowTo monitor your recovery, perform the
test again after one or two resting or easy training days. ~~~ Overreaching (7)
Your OwnOptimizer result indicates that you have had a very intensive training period for several days or
weeksYour heart rate has continuously remained at a high levelThis seriously indicates that you should
Tests
49
ENGLISH


have a complete recovery periodThe longer you have trained intensively, the longer the recovery period
required to recoverPerform the test again after at least two days of recovery.
Sympathetic Overtraining (8)
Your OwnOptimizer result indicates that you have had a very intensive training period for several days or
weeks, and your recovery has not been sufficientThis has resulted in a state of overtrainingTo return to
a normal training state, rest for a carefully monitored recovery periodFollow your recovery by performing
the OwnOptimizer Test 2–3 times a week.
Parasympathetic Overtraining (9)
Your heart rate has stayed at a low level, which is generally interpreted as a sign of a good recovery.
However, other parameters indicate parasympathetic overtrainingYou may have trained with high volumes
for a long time, and recovery may not have been sufficientCheck for other signs of overtraining, such as
decreased performance, increased fatigue, mood disturbances, sleeping problems, persistent muscle
soreness, and/or a feeling of being burnt out or staleYou may also have been subjected to other stresses.
In general, the development of parasympathetic overtraining requires a long history of heavy training
volumesTo recover from a state of parasympathetic overtraining, you have to recover body balance
completelyRecovering may take several weeksYou should not exercise, instead rest completely for most
of the recovery periodYou can possibly have a few days with some light aerobic training in short sessions,
and only occasionally include short, high-intensity sessions.
You can also consider doing other than your main sportHowever, it should be one you are familiar and
comfortable withMonitor your recovery by performing the OwnOptimizer Test 2–3 times a weekOnce you
feel you have recovered your body balance, and your result shows Normal State or Good recovery,
preferably more than once, you can then consider resuming trainingOnce you start training again, begin a
new testing period with new baseline measurements.
Before you radically change your training program, consider your OwnOptimizer results together with your
subjective feelings and any symptoms you may haveRepeat the OwnOptimizer test if you are unsure of the
standardized conditionsAn individual test result can be affected by several external factors, such as mental
stress, latent illness, environmental changes (temperature, altitude), and othersYou should update the baseline
calculations at least once a year, when you start a new training season.

Exercising in sport zone 1 is done at a very low intensityThe main training principle is that performance
improves when recovering after, and not only during, trainingAccelerate the recovery process with very
light intensity training.
Sport zone 2 is for endurance training, an essential part of any training programExercise sessions in this
zone are easy and aerobicLong-duration training in this light zone results in effective energy expenditure.
Progress will require persistence.
Aerobic power is enhanced in sport zone 3The training intensity is higher than in sport zones 1 and 2,

but still mainly aerobicTraining in sport zone 3 may, for example, consist of intervals followed by

recoveryExercising in this zone is especially effective for improving the efficiency of blood circulation in
the heart and skeletal muscles.
If your goal is to compete at top potential, you will have to train in sport zones 4 and 5In these zones,
you exercise anaerobically, in intervals of up to 10 minutesThe shorter the interval, the higher the
intensitySufficient recovery between intervals is very importantThe training pattern in zones 4 and 5 is ~~~ designed to produce peak performance.
The Polar sport zones can be personalized by using a laboratory measured HRmax value, or by taking a field

test to measure the value yourselfWhen exercising in a sport zone, try to make use of the entire zoneThe
mid-zone is a good target, but keeping your heart rate at that exact level all the time is not necessary.
Heart rate gradually adjusts to training intensityFor instance, when crossing from sport zone 1 to 3, the
circulatory system and heart rate will adjust in 3-5 minutes.
Heart rate responds to exercise intensity depending on factors such as fitness and recovery levels, as well
as environmental factorsIt is important to look out for subjective feelings of fatigue, and to adjust your
training program accordingly. ~~~ A simple way of making use of the sport zones is to work with target heart rate zonesFor further
instructions, see Plan Your Training (page 9).
After the exercise, exercise duration is displayed in sport zonesAccess the Weekly display to see in which
sport zones you have been exercising, and for how long.
The Polar ProTrainer 5 offers up to 10 sport zones to better serve your training needs and heart rate
reserve.
OwnZone Training
Your training computer determines automatically an individual and safe exercise intensity zone: your
OwnZoneThe unique Polar OwnZone defines your personal training zone for aerobic trainingThe function
guides you through your warm-up, and takes your present physical and mental condition into accountFor
most adults, OwnZone corresponds to 65-85% of maximum heart rate.
OwnZone can be determined in 1-5 minutes during a warm-up period by walking, jogging, or doing some
other sportThe idea is to start exercising slowly at a light intensity, and to gradually increase intensity
and heart rateOwnZone is developed for use by healthy peopleSome health conditions may cause heart
rate variability-based OwnZone determination to failThese conditions include high blood pressure,
cardiac arrhythmias, and certain medications.
Listening to and interpreting the signals your body sends during physical exertion is an important part of
getting fitSince warm-up routines differ for different types of exercise, and since your physical and
mental state may also vary from day to day (due to stress or illness), using the OwnZone function for every
session guarantees the most effective heart rate target zone for that particular type of exercise and day.
Maximum Heart Rate
Maximum heart rate (HRmax) is the highest number of heartbeats per minute (bpm) during maximum
physical exertionIt is individual and depends on age, hereditary factors, and fitness levelIt may also
vary according to the type of sport performedHRmax is used to express exercise intensity.
Determining Maximum Heart Rate
Your HR max can be determined in several ways.
The most accurate way is to have your HRmax clinically measured, usually on a maximal treadmill or by
taking a bicycle stress test supervised by a cardiologist or exercise physiologist.
You can also determine your HR max by taking a field test together with a training partner.
You can obtain a HR max-p score that predicts your HRmax by taking a Polar Fitness Test.
HRmax can also be estimated by using the commonly used formula: 220 - age, although research shows
that the method is not very accurate, especially for older persons or those who have been fit for many
54

years.




If you have done some hard training in recent weeks and know that you can safely reach maximum heart
rate, you can safely take a test to determine your HRmax yourselfHaving a training buddy with you during
the test is recommendedIf you are uncertain, consult your physician before undertaking the test.
Here is an example of a simple test.
Step 1: Warm up for 15 minutes on a flat surface, building up to your usual training pace.
Step 2: Choose a hill or stairwell that will take more than 2 minutes to climbRun up the hill/steps once,
building to as hard a pace as you can hold for 20 minutesReturn to the base of the hill/steps.
Step 3: Run up the hill/steps again, building towards a pace you could just about hold for 3 kilometers.
Note your highest heart rateYour maximum is approximately 10 beats higher than the noted value.
Step 4: Run back down the hill, allowing your heart rate to drop 30-40 beats per minute.
Step 5: Run up the hill/steps once again at a pace that you can only hold for 1 minuteTry to run halfway
up the hills/stepsNote your highest heart rateThis brings you close to your maximum heart rateUse this
value as your maximum heart rate to set training zones.
Step 6: Make sure you get a good cool-down, a minimum of 10 minutes.
Heart Rate Value in a Sitting Position
HRsit is your average heart rate when completely still (i.ewhile sitting)To easily determine HR sit, wear
your heart rate sensor, sit down, and do not engage in any physical activityFor a more precise
measurement, repeat the procedure several times and calculate your average.
Heart Rate Reserve
Heart rate reserve (HRR) is the difference between maximum heart rate (HRmax), and resting heart rate
(HRrest)HRR is used to calculate exercise heart ratesIt is the range within which heart rate varies
depending on exertion levelHRR equals oxygen uptake reserve (VO2R).
Exercise heart rate can be determined by using the Karvonen formulaAdd the given percentage of heart
rate reserve to resting heart rate.
Exercise HR = % of target intensity (HRmax – HRrest) + HRrest
Example:
Target intensity 70 % HRR for a person with HR max 201 bpm and HRrest 50 bpm
Exercise HR= 70% (201-50) + 50
Exercise HR=156 bpm
For a precise exercise heart rate, you need your exact HRmax and HRrestWhen using estimated HRmax,
exercise heart rate values are always estimates.
In Polar RS800CX training computer, the heart rate value during a resting state is measured in a sitting
position (HRsit)This is for practical reasons since HRsit is used in energy expenditure calculation because
of accuracyHR sit matches the low intensity to which different exercise intensities can be compared.
Karvonen M, Kentala K, Mustala OThe effects of training on heart rate: a longitudinal studyAnn Med
Exp Biol Fenn 1957; 35: 307-315.
Heart Rate Variability ~~~ Heart rate varies with every heartbeatHeart rate variability (HRV) is the variation of beat to beat intervals,
also known as R-R intervals.
Background Information
55
ENGLISH





HRV indicates the fluctuations of heart rate around an average heart rateAn average heart rate of 60
beats per minute (bpm) does not mean that the interval between successive heartbeats would be exactly
1.0 sec, instead they may fluctuate/vary from 0.5 sec up to 2.0 sec.
HRV is affected by aerobic fitnessHRV of a well-conditioned heart is generally large at restOther factors
that affect HRV are age, genetics, body position, time of day, and health statusDuring exercise, HRV
decreases as heart rate and exercise intensity increaseHRV also decreases during periods of mental
stress.
HRV is regulated by the autonomic nervous systemParasympathetic activity decreases heart rate and
increases HRV, whereas sympathetic activity increases heart rate and decreases HRV.
HRV is used in the Ownzone, OwnIndex, and in OwnOptimizer featuresIt can also be monitored on its
own using the training computerIf your HRV changes at a given pace and heart rate, this may indicate a
change in your training load and stress.
Running Cadence and Stride Length
Cadence is the number of times the foot with the stride sensor hits the ground per minute.
Stride length is the average length of one stepThat is the distance between your right and left foot
contacting the ground.
Running speed = 2 stride length cadence
There are two ways to run faster: moving your legs at a higher cadence or taking longer steps.
Elite long distance runners typically run with a high cadence of 85-95On uphills, typical cadence values
are lowerOn downhills they are higherRunners adjust stride length to gather speed: stride length
increases as speed increases.
Yet one of the most common mistakes novice runners make is over-stridingThe most efficient stride
length is the natural one – the one that feels most comfortableYou will run faster in races by
strengthening your leg muscles so they take you forward with a longer stride.
You should also work on maximizing cadence efficiencyCadence does not progress easily, but if properly
trained, you will be able to sustain it throughout your runs and maximize your performanceTo develop
cadence, the nerve-muscle connection needs to be trained - and reasonably frequentlyA session of
cadence training a week is a good startIncorporate some cadence work into the rest of your weekDuring
long easy runs, you could include some faster cadence every now and then.
When training for longer running events (½ Marathon, Marathon or longer), it may be helpful to monitor
cadenceA low cadence at expected race pace can cause problems later in the event, as your legs tire.
56
Background Information
ENGLISH
One way around this is to work on increasing leg speed at expected race paceYou can set your training
computer to show pace and cadenceTry to shorten your stride and increase cadence while holding the




same pace (set a narrow pace zone to give you audio feedback).You can aim to raise running cadence

above the following:
80/min (4hour Marathoners)
85/min (3hr 30min Marathoners)
88/min (3hour Marathoners)
This is a general guide only, taller runners will naturally have slightly lower cadencesRunners should also
tune in to what feels comfortable for them personally.
A good way of improving stride length is to undertake specific strength work, like running hills, running in
soft sand, or running up stepsA six-week training period including strength work should result in
noticeable improvements in stride length, and if combined with some faster leg speed work (such as short
strides at best 5km pace), noticeable improvements should be seen in overall speed, as well.

Optional s3/s3+ stride sensor W.I.N.Drequired.
R-R Recording
R-R recording rate saves heartbeat intervals, i.eintervals between successive heartbeatsThis information
is also shown as instantaneous heart rate in beats per minute in recorded samples.
When recording every single interval, extra systoles and artefacts can also be seenWe recommend using
contact gel (ECG gel) to optimize contact between your skin and the heart rate sensorReadings
interpreted as incorrect in the heart rate data can be adjusted and corrected with the software.
Polar Running Index
Running Index offers an easy way to monitor performance changesPerformance (how fast/easily you run
at a given pace) is directly influenced by aerobic fitness (VO2max) and exercise economy (how efficient
your body is at running), and Running Index is a measurement of this influenceBy recording your
Running Index over time, you can monitor progressImprovement means that running at a given pace
requires less of an effort, or that your pace is faster at a given level of exertionThe Running Index feature
calculates such improvementsRunning Index also gives you daily information on your running
performance level which may vary from day to day.
Benefits of Running Index:
emphasizes the positive effects of good training sessions and resting days.
monitors fitness and performance development at different heart rate levels - not only during maximal
performance.
you can determine your optimal running speed by comparing running indexes from different kinds of ~~~ trainings.
stresses progress through better running technique and fitness level.
Running Index is calculated during every exercise when heart rate and the s3/s3+ stride sensor/ G3/G5
GPS sensor signal is recorded, and when the following requirements apply:
speed should be 6km/h / 3,75 mi/h or faster and duration 12 minutes minimum.
heart rate should be above 40% HRmax.
Make sure that the stride sensor is calibratedCalculation begins when you start recording the session.
During the session, you may stop once at traffic lights, for example, without interrupting the calculation.
In the end, your training computer displays a Running Index value and stores the result in the File section.
Compare your result to the table belowUsing the software, you can monitor and analyze your progress in
Running Index values against time and different running speedsOr compare values from different
exercise sessions and analyze them in the short and long term.

Precautions
Interference During Exercise
Electromagnetic Interference and Exercise Equipment
Disturbance may occur near microware ovens and computersAlso WLAN base stations may cause
interference when exercising with RS800CXTo avoid erratic reading or misbehaviors, move away from

possible sources of disturbance.
Exercise equipment with electronic or electrical components such as LED displays, motors and electrical
brakes may cause interfering stray signalsTo solve these problems, try the following:
1.
2.
3.
Remove the heart rate sensor from your chest and use the exercise equipment as you would normally.
Move the training computer around until you find an area in which it displays no stray reading or does not
flash the heart symbolInterference is often worst directly in front of the display panel of the equipment,
while the left or right side of the display is relatively free of disturbance.
Put the heart rate sensor back on your chest and keep the training computer in this interference-free area
as much as possible.
If the training computer still does not work with the exercise equipment, it may be electrically too noisy
for wireless heart rate measurement.
Using RS800 Training Computer in Water
The training computer is water resistantHowever, heart rate measurement does not work in waterYou
can use the training computer under water as a watch but it is not a diving instrumentTo maintain water
resistance, do not press the buttons of the training computer under waterUsing the training computer in
excessive rainfall may also cause interference.
Minimizing Risks When Exercising
Exercise may include some riskBefore beginning a regular exercise program, it is recommended that you
answer the following questions concerning your health statusIf you answer yes to any of these questions,
we recommend that you consult a doctor before starting any training program.
Have you been physically inactive for the past 5 years?
Do you have high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol?

Do you smoke?
Are you pregnant?
Note that in addition to exercise intensity, medications for heart conditions, blood pressure, psychological
conditions, asthma, breathing, etc., as well as some energy drinks, alcohol, and nicotine may also affect ~~~ heart rate.
It is important to be sensitive to your body’s responses during exerciseIf you feel unexpected pain or
excessive fatigue when exercising, it is recommended that you stop the exercise or continue at a lighter
intensity.
Note!
If you are using a pacemaker, you can use Polar training computersIn theory interference to
pacemaker caused by Polar products should not be possibleIn practice no reports exist to suggest anyone
ever having experienced interferenceWe cannot however issue an official guarantee on our products'

suitability with all pacemakers or other implanted devices due to the variety of devices availableIf you
have any doubts, or if you experience any unusual sensations while using Polar products, please consult

your physician or contact the implanted electronic device manufacturer to determine safety in your case.
If you are allergic to any substance that comes into contact with your skin or if you suspect an allergic
reaction due to using the product, check the listed materials in Technical SpecificationsTo avoid any
skin reaction to the heart rate sensor, wear it over a shirt, but moisten the shirt well under the electrodes
to ensure flawless operation.
Your safety is important to usThe shape of the s3/s3+ stride sensor is designed to minimize the
possibility of it getting caught in somethingIn any case, be careful when running with the stride sensor in
brushwood, for example.
The combined impact of moisture and intense abrasion may cause a black color to come off the heart rate sensor’s
surface, possibly staining light-colored clothesIf you use insect repellent on your skin, you must ensure that it
does not come into contact with the heart rate sensor.

Suggestion on food storage
Storing food
Opening the door often or keeping the door opened a
long time, increases the inside temperatureThis causes
the storage life and flavor of the foods to reduce, and
increases the energy consumption.
Do not touch deep-frozen foods with wet hands.
You could get chilblains on your hands.
NOTE ~~~ Make sure foods that are not frozen do not touch the
frozen foodsThe frozen foods may melt.
The packing materials suitable for refrigerating the foods are
- Polyethylene bags, Plastic foil, freezing containers.
The suitable wrapping materials are
- Rubber band, Plastic clips, attaching tape, string.
Before sealing, get rid of air from packing bags and foil.
The remained air makes the storing foods dry.
You can freeze foods quickly when packing is levelDo
not store bottles in freezer compartmentThey may
break when frozen.
Making Ice
To make ice cubes, fill ice
tray 3/4 full with water and
place it on the bottom of the
freezer compartment.
To remove ice cubes, hold the ice tray at its ends and
twist gently.
To remove ice cubes easily, run water on the tray
before twisting. ~~~ s

Care and Maintenance
Defrosting
Defrosting the fridge compartment
When the freezer is working, frost is formed at the
rear wall of the fridge compartment and melts
automatically when the compressor stops.

Defrosting the freezer compartment
Humidity forms frost or ice in the freezer compartment
while the appliance is working or when the freezer door
is openedThe thick ice and frost decrease cool air and
increase the energy consumption.
Defrost Ice Layer
If the freezer compartment is heavily iced, defrost as
follows.
- Remove the frozen food, wrap in newspaper and store
in a cool place.
- Leave the door open, and wipe out water with a
sponge. ~~~ - Dry the freezer compartment thoroughly, turn on the
appliance, and replace frozen foods.
It is helpful to place a saucepan with hot water inside
of the freezing room in order to assist defrost.

Important safety instructions
Safety instructions for use
To minimize the risk of fire within the inner bowl, the following should be observed:
Items that have been spotted or
soaked with vegetable or cooking oil
constitute a fire hazard and should
not be placed in a tumble dryer.
Oil-affected items can ignite spontaneously,
especially when exposed to heat sources
such as in a tumble dryer.
The items become warm, causing an
oxidation reaction in the oilOxidation
creates heatIf the heat cannot escape, the
items can become hot enough to catch fire.
Piling, stacking or storing oil-affected items

can prevent heat from escaping and so
create a fire hazardIf it is unavoidable that
fabrics that contain vegetable or cooking oil
or have been contaminated by hair care
products be placed in a tumble dryer they
should first be washed in hot water with
extra detergent-this will reduce, but not
eliminate, the hazard.
The ‘cool down’ cycle of tumble dryers
should be used to reduce the temperature of
the items.
They should not be removed from the tumble
dryer or piled or stacked while hot.
Items that have been previously
cleaned in, washed in, soaked in or
spotted with petrol/gasoline, drycleaning solvents or other flammable
or explosive substances should not
be placed in a tumble dryerHighly

Items containing foam rubber (also
known as latex foam) or similarly
textured rubber like materials should

not be dried in a tumble dryer on a
heat settingFoam rubber materials can,
when heated, produce fire by spontaneous
combustion.
Fabric softeners or similar products
should not be used during a drying
cycle, to eliminate the effects of static
electricity unless this practice is specifically
recommended by the manufacturer of the
fabric softener or product.
Undergarments that contain metal
reinforcements should not be placed
in a tumble dryer.
Damage to the tumble dryer can result if
metal reinforcements come loose during
dryingWhen available a drying rack could

be used for such items.
Plastic articles such as shower caps
or babies waterproof napkin covers
should not be placed in a tumble ~~~ dryer.
Rubber-backed articles, clothes fitted
with foam rubber pads, pillows,
rubber boots and rubber-coated
tennis shoes should not be placed in
a tumble dryer.
flammable substances commonly used in
domestic environments include acetone,
denatured alcohol, petrol/gasoline,
kerosene, spot removers (some brands),

NOTE
SMARTDIAGNOSIS™ function is available only for the products with a SMARTDIAGNOSIS™ mark.
In case of a mobile phone with static option, the SMARTDIAGNOSIS™ function might not operate.
 Using SMARTDIAGNOSIS™
Only use this feature when instructed to do so by the call center.
The transmission sounds similar to a fax machine, and so has no meaning except to the call
center.
SMARTDIAGNOSIS™ cannot be activated if the washer does not power up.
If this happens, then troubleshooting must be done without SMARTDIAGNOSIS™.
If you experience problems with your washer, call to Customer Information Center.
Follow the call center agent's instructions, and do the following steps when requested:
1Press the Power button to turn on the washer.

Do not press any other buttons or turn the cycle
selector knob.
2When instructed to do so by the call center,
place the mouthpiece of your phone very close
to the Power button.
Max10 mm
3Press and hold the “Temp.” button for three seconds, while holding the phone mouthpiece
to the icon or Power button.
4Keep the phone in place until the tone transmission has finished.
This takes about 17 seconds, and the display will count down the time.
For best results, do not move the phone while the tones are being transmitted.
If the call center agent is not able to get an accurate recording of the data, you may be
asked to try again.
Pressing the Power button during the transmission will shut off the SMARTDIAGNOSIS™.
5Once the countdown is over and the tones have stopped, resume your conversation with
the call center agent, who will then be able to assist you using the information transmitted
for analysis at the call to Customer information center.

must be cleaned regularly to remove any
build up of lime scale on the surface of the
sensor.
Wipe the sensors inside drum.

development (for example: trying to touch the screen or trying to jump into itSpecial monitoring
and extra attention is required for children watching 3D contents.
- Children have greater binocular disparity of 3D presentations than adults because the distance
between the eyes is shorter than one of adultsTherefore they will perceive more stereoscopic
depth compared to adults for the same 3D image.

3D FUNCTION
3D FUNCTION
3D technology uses different video frames for each eye to add depth to the video.
While Watching 3D

WARNING
yy If you view 3D video or images too
closely for a long period of time, your
eyesight may become worse.
yy If you watch the projector or game
screen for a long time with 3D glasses

on, you may experience dizziness or
eye fatigue.
yy People with chronic diseases
(epilepsy, cardiovascular disease,
blood pressure-related diseases,
etc.
), pregnant women, and people
with serious motion sickness should
avoid watching 3D video.
yy People with stereo blindness, or with
stereopsis problems, should also

avoid watching 3D video contentIt
may cause double vision or visual
discomfort.
yy People with strabismus, amblyopia,
or astigmatism may have difficulty
perceiving video depth and may be
fatigued easily due to double vision
or other ailmentsIt is recommended
to rest more frequently than other
viewers.

yy Because 3D can be recognized as
real, some viewers may get surprised
or overexcited.
yy Do not watch 3D images near fragile
objects or any objects that can be
knocked over easily.
yy Take care not to injure yourself as
you may subconsciously try to move
away from the life-like 3D images.

3D FUNCTION
yy Warning about photosensitivity
seizures
- Some users may experience a
seizure or other abnormal symptoms
when they are exposed to a flashing
light or particular patterns from a
video gameIf anyone in your family
has a history of epilepsy or has ever
experienced any kind of seizure,
please consult your doctor before
viewing 3D images.
If you experience one of the following
symptoms while watching a 3D
video, stop watching the 3D video
immediately and take a rest.

- Dizziness, switched eyesight,
twitching of the eye or facial
muscles, involuntary movements,
cramp, loss of consciousness,
confusion, loss of sense of direction,
or nauseaIf the symptom does
not disappear, please consult your ~~~ doctor.
yy You can reduce the risk of
photosensitive seizures by taking the
following preventive measures.
- Take a rest of 5 to 15 minsfor every
1 hour of viewing.
- If vision varies between each eye,
correct the variation before beginning
to watch a 3D video.
- Ensure that the 3D video is directly in
front of you, at eye level.
- You should stop watching if you
experience a headache, fatigue or
dizziness.
- Do not view 3D images for a long
period of time when you are tired or ill.
49
CAUTION
yy Extra special care is required for
children watching a 3D video.
When Watching 3D Video
yy Prevent children of 5 years or
younger from watching a 3D videoIt
may impair the development of their
eyes.
yy Children 10 years old or younger are
still developing their eyesight and may
have an excessive tendency to touch
or jump at the screenAdult guidance
and supervision is recommended.
yy Since the distance between the eyes
is narrower for children than in adults,
children tend to notice a greater
difference in the images seen by each
eyeTherefore, even while watching
the same 3D video, children may
have a greater depth perception than
adults.
yy Young people of 19 years old or
younger may respond with sensitivity
to the light stimuli of 3D content.
Excessive viewing when fatigued is
not recommended.
yy Elderly viewers may have a reduced
depth perception than younger
viewersAvoid watching video nearer
than the recommended distance.
yy Watch 3D images within the optimum
viewing angle and distance.
yy If you are outside the viewing angle
or distance, you may not be able to
see 3D imagesYou cannot view 3D
images when you are lying down.
50
3D FUNCTION
yy You may see left and right images
overlapped during projector
initialization after it is powered onIt
may take some time for optimization.

yy It may take some time for the 3D
image to look normal after you turn
your eyes away from the screen and
look back at the 3D image.

yy It may flicker slightly while watching
3D images under a 3 wavelength
lamp fluorescent light (50 Hz to
60 Hz) or near windowsIf so, it is

recommended to block the sun light
with a curtain and to dim the lights.
yy The 3D glasses must be DLP-LINK
(DLP Ready) type.
yy You may not be able to watch 3D
properly if there is an obstacle
between the projector and 3D
glasses. ~~~ yy Install the 3D projector as far as
possible from other devices.
yy If a future 3D broadcasting format
that is not supported by this projector
becomes the standard, an additional
device such as a set-top box may be ~~~ required.
Please check the following when
using 3D glasses.
yy Do not use 3D glasses as ordinary

glasses, sunglasses or protective
goggles.
- If you do so, this may cause injury.
yy Do not store 3D glasses in very hot
or very cold conditionsIf you do, this
may cause them to become distorted.
Do not use distorted glasses.
yy Do not drop 3D glasses or allow
them to come into contact with other ~~~ objects.
- This may cause product malfunction.
yy The lenses of 3D glasses are easily
scratchedUse a soft clean cloth
when cleaning them.
yy Foreign particles on the cloth may
cause scratches.
yy Do not scratch the surface of the 3D
glasses' lenses with sharp objects

Suggestion on food storage
Storing food
Opening the door often or keeping the door opened a
long time, increases the inside temperatureThis causes
the storage life and flavor of the foods to reduce, and
increases the energy consumption.
Do not touch deep-frozen foods with wet hands.
You could get chilblains on your hands.
NOTE ~~~ Make sure foods that are not frozen do not touch the
frozen foodsThe frozen foods may melt.
The packing materials suitable for refrigerating the foods are
- Polyethylene bags, Plastic foil, freezing containers.
The suitable wrapping materials are
- Rubber band, Plastic clips, attaching tape, string.
Before sealing, get rid of air from packing bags and foil.
The remained air makes the storing foods dry.
You can freeze foods quickly when packing is levelDo
not store bottles in freezer compartmentThey may
break when frozen.
Making Ice
To make ice cubes, fill ice
tray 3/4 full with water and
place it on the bottom of the
freezer compartment.
To remove ice cubes, hold the ice tray at its ends and
twist gently.
To remove ice cubes easily, run water on the tray
before twisting. ~~~ s

Care and Maintenance
Defrosting
Defrosting the fridge compartment
When the freezer is working, frost is formed at the
rear wall of the fridge compartment and melts
automatically when the compressor stops.

Defrosting the freezer compartment
Humidity forms frost or ice in the freezer compartment
while the appliance is working or when the freezer door
is openedThe thick ice and frost decrease cool air and
increase the energy consumption.
Defrost Ice Layer
If the freezer compartment is heavily iced, defrost as
follows.
- Remove the frozen food, wrap in newspaper and store
in a cool place.
- Leave the door open, and wipe out water with a
sponge. ~~~ - Dry the freezer compartment thoroughly, turn on the
appliance, and replace frozen foods.
It is helpful to place a saucepan with hot water inside
of the freezing room in order to assist defrost.

Suggestions on food storage ~~~ Storing Food
Do not store food which goes bad easily at low
temperature, such as banana, and melon.
w Caution

Allow hot food to cool prior to storingPlacing hot food

in the fridge-freezer could spoil other food, and lead to
higher electric bills.
When storing the food, use a container with a lidThis
prevents moisture from evaporating, and helps food to
keep its taste and nutrients.
Do not block air vents with foodSmooth circulation of
cold air keeps fridge-freezer temperature even.
Do not open the door frequentlyOpening the door lets
warm air enter the fridge-freezer, and cause
temperature to rise.
Never keep too many foods in door rack, as this may
stop the door from fully closing.
Do not store bottles in the freezer compartment - they
may break when frozen.
Do not refreeze food that has been thawedThis causes
loss of taste and nutrition.
Do not store pharmaceutical products, scientific
materials or other temperature sensitive products in the
refrigerator.
Products that require strict temperature controls must
not be stored in the refrigerator.

Calibrate the Polar s3/s3+ Stride Sensor W.I.N.D.
Optional calibration of the s3/s3+ sensor improves accuracy of speed, pace, and distance measurements.
It is recommended that you calibrate the sensor before using it for the first time, if there are significant
changes in your running style, or if the position of the sensor on the shoe is dramatically changed (e.gif
you have new running shoes)You can calibrate the sensor by running a known distance, or by setting the
calibration factor manually.
You can calibrate one s3/s3+ sensor for each shoe setting.
Calibrate Sensor by Running a Distance (on-the-fly calibration)
You can calibrate the sensor at any phase of your exercise with lap distance correction, provided you are
not exercising with distance-based targetsJust run a known distance, preferably more than 1000 meters.
Make sure the sensor function in the training computer is on (Settings > Features > Shoes/bikes > Shoes
1/2/3 > On).

Determine Your OwnZone
For background information on Polar OwnZone®, see OwnZone Training (page 54).
Find your OwnZone in 1-5 minutes during a warm-up period by walking and joggingYou should start
exercising gently at a light intensity and gradually increase intensity to raise your heart rate.
Redefine your OwnZone:
When changing exercise environment or exercise mode.
When taking up exercise after more than a week’s break.
If you are not 100 percent sure of your physical or mental state – for example, if you are not recovered
from previous training, not feeling well, or are stressed.
After changing user settings.
Before you start to determine your OwnZone, make sure that:
Your user settings are correct.
You select the OwnZone exerciseEvery time you start the OwnZone exercise, the training computer will
automatically determine your OwnZone.

Wear the heart rate sensor and stride sensor as instructedStart measurement by pressing OK twice.
When your exercise starts, OZ is displayed and OwnZone determination begins.
Determination of your OwnZone happens in five stagesAfter each stage, you will hear a beep (if the
sound settings are on) indicating the end of the stage.
OZ > Walk at a slow pace for 1 minKeep your heart rate below 100 bpm / 50% HR max during this first ~~~ stage.

Select Settings > Features > Shoes/bikes > Bike 1/2/3 > Wheel
Wheel size settings are a prerequisite for correct cycling informationThere are two ways of determining
the wheel size of your bike:
Method 1
Look for the diameter in inches or in ETRTO printed on the wheelMatch it to the wheel size in
millimeters in the right column of the chart.

Wheel sizes on the chart are advisory as wheel size depends on the wheel type and air pressure.
Method 2
Measure the wheel manually for the most accurate result.
Use the valve to mark the point where the wheel touches the groundDraw a line on the ground to mark
that pointMove your bike forward on a flat surface for one complete rotationThe tire should be
perpendicular to the groundDraw another line on the ground at the valve to mark a full rotationMeasure
the distance between the two lines.
Subtract 4 mm to account for your weight on the bike to get your wheel circumferenceEnter this value in ~~~ the cycling computer.

To teach a new sensor, make sure that there are no other s3/s3+ stride sensors or G3/G5 GPS sensors
nearby (40 m/131 ft) and then select Yes.
To return to time mode, press and hold the STOP button.
Altitude
The training computer converts measured air pressure into an altitude readingChange the settings of the
altimeter in the Altitude menuYou can calibrate the altimeter manually or automatically.
Set the altitude function on or off
Select Settings > Features > Altitude > On / Off
Calibrating the Altitude Manually
Select Settings > Features > Altitude > Calibrate > set the altitude of current location
If the altitude of your location differs significantly from the displayed altitude value Calibrate to xx?
is
displayed.
Yes: Altitude calibrated to xx is displayed.
No: Altitude calibration canceled is displayedThe last altitude value stored in the training computer’s
memory is applied.
Calibrate the altitude to ensure it remains accurateSet the reference altitude whenever a reliable
reference, such as a peak or a topographic map, is available or when at sea level.
Calibrating the Altitude Automatically
Select Settings > Features > Altitude > AutoCalib > On / Off
When automatic calibration is on, the last altitude value stored in the training computer’s memory is
applied when exercisingThis feature is especially useful if you always start a session in the same
environmentIf automatic calibration fails, you are not in the usual environment and will need to calibrate
the altitude manually.
Altitude calibrated to xx m/ft indicates that calibration has succeededIf Altitude calibration failed is
displayed, re-calibrate the altitude.
Recording Rate
Select Settings > Features > Rec.rate > 1 / 2 / 5 / 15 / 60 sec

The training computer can store your heart rate, speed/pace, and altitude in 1, 2, 5, 15 or 60 second
intervalsA longer interval gives you more recording time, while a shorter interval allows you to record
more heart and other dataThis enables accurate data analysis using the software.
A shorter recording rate consumes the memory of the training computer more rapidlyThe remaining
recording time is displayed on the lower row when setting the rateDefault recording rate is 5 seconds.
When less than 30 minutes of maximum recording time is left, the recording rate changes automatically to
longer recording time (1s > 2s > 5s > 15s > 60s)This will maximize the time to record exercise data.
When the session ends, the current recording rate remains as default.
The following table shows the maximum recording times for each recording rateNote that recording rate
might change when there is less than 30 minutes of recording time left.

This is a sum of 2 or more exercises; maximum duration of a single exercise is 99 h 59 min 59 sThe
maximum recording time can be shorter, if you record a large number of short exercises.
The durations in the table are estimatesFor RR data, maximum recording time depends on heart rate and
variation of heart rateIf you record laps in your exercise, and/or if you have created an exercise that includes
phases with the software, the maximum recording time will decrease.
Recording doesn't automatically stop when the memory becomes fullTherefore, exercise time may be
longer than recording time.
RR Data Function
Select Settings > Features > RR data > On / Off
The RR data recording function measures and records heartbeat variations within one millisecond
resolutionThis enables the analysis (accuracy 1ms) of heart rate variability (HRV) using the softwareThe

Activity Level
Activity level is an assessment of your level of long-term physical activitySelect the alternative that best
describes the overall amount and intensity of your physical activity during the past three months.
Top: You participate in heavy physical exercise at least 5 times a week, or you exercise to improve
performance for competitive purposes.
High: You participate at least 3 times a week in heavy physical exercise, e.gyou run 20-50 km/12-31
miles per week or spend 3-5 hours per week in comparable physical activity.
Moderate: You participate regularly in recreational sports, e.gyou run 5-10 km or 3-6 miles per week or
spend 1/2-2 hours per week in comparable physical activity, or your work requires modest physical ~~~ activity.
Low: You do not participate regularly in programmed recreational sport or heavy physical activity, e.gyou
walk only for pleasure or exercise hard enough to cause heavy breathing or perspiration only occasionally.
In the training computer, these values are used to calculate your energy expenditure.
Heart Rate: HRmax, HRsit

HRmax (Maximum heart rate): Your age-predicted HR max value (220 - age) is used as a defaultSet your
HRmax manually if your maximum heart rate has been determined in a lab, or if you have tested your
maximum heart rate in the field yourself.
HRsit (Heart rate value in a sitting position): Set your HRsit value if you have determined it according to
the instructionsFor instructions, see Heart Rate Value in a Sitting Position (page 55).
Maximal Oxygen Intake: VO2max
VO2max is your body’s maximum capacity for oxygen consumption during maximum exertionThe most
accurate way of determining VO2max is to perform a maximal stress test in a laboratoryIf you know your
exact clinically-tested VO2max, set the value in the training computerOtherwise, measure a comparable
value, OwnIndex, by taking the Polar Fitness TestFor further information, see Polar Fitness Test TM

Polar Fitness Test TM
The Polar Fitness Test TM is an easy, safe, and quick way to measure your aerobic (cardiovascular) fitness
at restThe result, Polar OwnIndex, is comparable to maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), which is commonly
used to evaluate aerobic fitnessYour long-term level of physical activity, heart rate, heart rate variability
at rest, gender, age, height, and body weight all influence OwnIndexThe Polar Fitness Test is developed
for use by healthy adults.
Aerobic fitness relates to how well your cardiovascular system works to transport oxygen to your bodyThe
better your aerobic fitness, the stronger and more efficient your heart isGood aerobic fitness has many
health benefitsFor example, it helps in decreasing high blood pressure and your risk of cardiovascular
diseases and strokeIf you want to improve your aerobic fitness it takes, on average, six weeks of regular
training to see a noticeable change in your OwnIndexLess fit individuals see progress even more rapidly.
The better your aerobic fitness, the smaller the improvements in your OwnIndex.

Aerobic fitness is best improved by exercise types that use large muscle groupsSuch activities include
running, cycling, walking, rowing, swimming, skating, and cross-country skiing.
To monitor your progress, start by measuring your OwnIndex a couple of times during the first two weeks
in order to get a baseline value, and then repeat the test approximately once a month.
With the Polar Fitness Test, you can also calculate the predicted maximum heart rate value (HR max-p)The
HRmax-p score predicts your individual maximum heart rate more accurately than the age-based formula
(220 - age)For further information on HRmax, see User Settings (page 37).
To make sure the test results are reliable, the following basic requirements apply:
You can perform the test anywhere - at home, at the office, at a health club - provided the testing
environment is peacefulThere should be no disturbing noises (e.gtelevision, radio, or telephone) and no
other people talking to you.
Always take the test in the same environment and at the same hour.
Avoid eating a heavy meal or smoking 2-3 hours prior to testing.
Avoid heavy physical exertion, alcohol, and pharmacological stimulants on the test day and the previous ~~~ day.
You should be relaxed and calmLie down and relax for 1-3 minutes before starting the test.

Polar OwnOptimizerTM
General
Successful training requires temporary overloading: longer exercise duration, higher intensity, or higher
total volumeIn order to avoid severe overtraining, overloading must always be followed by an adequate
recovery periodWith an inadequate recovery period, you may experience a decrease in performance as a
result of high training volumes, instead of improvementPolar OwnOptimizer is an easy and reliable way to
determine whether your training program is optimally developing your performancePolar OwnOptimizer is
developed for use by healthy adults.
Polar OwnOptimizer is a modification of a traditional orthostatic overtraining testIt is a perfect tool,
embedded in the training computer, for everyone training regularly, at least three times a week, for fitness
improvement or to reach competitive targetsThis feature is based on heart rate and heart rate variability
measurements taken during an orthostatic test (standing up from relaxed resting)OwnOptimizer helps you
to optimize your training load during a training program so that you experience an increase in performance
and do not undertrain or overtrain in the long runPolar OwnOptimizer is based on regular long-term
measurements of five heart rate parametersTwo of these five values are calculated at rest, one while
standing up, and two while standingEach time you perform the test, the wrist unit saves the heart rate
values and compares them to the previous values registered.
Before the Test
Baseline Tests
When you use OwnOptimizer for the first time, six baseline tests should be conducted over a period of two
weeks to determine your personal baseline valueThese baseline measurements should be taken during
two typical basic training weeks, not during heavy training weeksThe baseline measurements should
include tests taken after a training day and after recovery days.
Monitoring OwnOptimizer Values
After the baseline recordings, you should continue to perform the test 2-3 times a weekTest yourself
weekly in the morning following both a recovery day and a heavy training day (or a series of heavy training
days)An optional third test can be performed after a normal training dayOwnOptimizer may not provide
reliable information during detraining or in a very irregular training periodIf you take a break from
exercise for 14 days or longer, the baseline tests should be performed again.
Performing the Test
The test should always be taken in standardized/similar conditions in order to get the most reliable results.
It is recommended that you take the test in the morning before breakfastThe following basic
requirements apply: ~~~ Wear the heart rate sensor.
You should be relaxed and calm.
You can be seated in a relaxed position or lying in bedThe position should always be the same when you
do the test.
The test can take place anywhere – at home, in the office, at a health club – as long as the test
environment is peacefulThere should be no disturbing noises (for example, television, radio or telephone)
or other people talking to you.
Avoid eating, drinking and smoking 2-3 hours prior to the test.

textile strap fits snugly.
After the Test
How to Interpret Results
The wrist unit calculates five heart rate and heart rate variability based parametersThe OwnOptimizer
values are calculated by comparing your latest results to previous onesThe wrist unit will display a
written description of your training statusThe descriptions are defined in detail below.
Good Recovery (1)
Your heart rate is lower than averageThis indicates that you have recovered very wellYou can continue
training, including intensive exercise sessions.
Normal State (2)
Your heart rate is at a normal levelGo on with your training; include both light and intensive training
sessions, and recovery days.
Training Effect (3)
Your heart rate is higher than averageYou may have exercised intensively in the previous daysYou have
two choices: 1) rest or train lightly for one or two days, or 2) continue intensive training for one or two
days and then recover wellOther sources of stress such as the beginning of a fever or an attack of the flu
can result in the same kind of response.
Steady State (4)
Your heart rate has continuously been at a normal level for a long time nowEffective training requires
both heavy training and good recovery, and this should cause variation in your heart rate resultsYour
OwnOptimizer result indicates that you have not had very intensive training or good recovery for a while.
Perform the test again after a rest or light training dayIf the recovery is effective, your result should show
Good recovery.
Stagnant State (5)
Your heart rate is still at a normal level, and this has continued for a long timeThe result indicates that
your training has not been intensive enough to develop optimallyTo improve your condition effectively,
you should now include more intense or longer exercise sessions in your program.
Hard Training (6)
Your heart rate has been higher than average several timesYou may have trained hard on purposeThe
result indicates overloading, and you should try to recover well nowTo monitor your recovery, perform the
test again after one or two resting or easy training days. ~~~ Overreaching (7)
Your OwnOptimizer result indicates that you have had a very intensive training period for several days or
weeksYour heart rate has continuously remained at a high levelThis seriously indicates that you should
Tests

ENGLISH


have a complete recovery periodThe longer you have trained intensively, the longer the recovery period
required to recoverPerform the test again after at least two days of recovery.
Sympathetic Overtraining (8)
Your OwnOptimizer result indicates that you have had a very intensive training period for several days or
weeks, and your recovery has not been sufficientThis has resulted in a state of overtrainingTo return to
a normal training state, rest for a carefully monitored recovery periodFollow your recovery by performing
the OwnOptimizer Test 2–3 times a week.
Parasympathetic Overtraining (9)
Your heart rate has stayed at a low level, which is generally interpreted as a sign of a good recovery.
However, other parameters indicate parasympathetic overtrainingYou may have trained with high volumes
for a long time, and recovery may not have been sufficientCheck for other signs of overtraining, such as
decreased performance, increased fatigue, mood disturbances, sleeping problems, persistent muscle
soreness, and/or a feeling of being burnt out or staleYou may also have been subjected to other stresses.
In general, the development of parasympathetic overtraining requires a long history of heavy training
volumesTo recover from a state of parasympathetic overtraining, you have to recover body balance
completelyRecovering may take several weeksYou should not exercise, instead rest completely for most
of the recovery periodYou can possibly have a few days with some light aerobic training in short sessions,
and only occasionally include short, high-intensity sessions.
You can also consider doing other than your main sportHowever, it should be one you are familiar and
comfortable withMonitor your recovery by performing the OwnOptimizer Test 2–3 times a weekOnce you
feel you have recovered your body balance, and your result shows Normal State or Good recovery,
preferably more than once, you can then consider resuming trainingOnce you start training again, begin a
new testing period with new baseline measurements.
Before you radically change your training program, consider your OwnOptimizer results together with your
subjective feelings and any symptoms you may haveRepeat the OwnOptimizer test if you are unsure of the
standardized conditionsAn individual test result can be affected by several external factors, such as mental
stress, latent illness, environmental changes (temperature, altitude), and othersYou should update the baseline
calculations at least once a year, when you start a new training season.

but still mainly aerobicTraining in sport zone 3 may, for example, consist of intervals followed by

recoveryExercising in this zone is especially effective for improving the efficiency of blood circulation in
the heart and skeletal muscles.
If your goal is to compete at top potential, you will have to train in sport zones 4 and 5In these zones,
you exercise anaerobically, in intervals of up to 10 minutesThe shorter the interval, the higher the
intensitySufficient recovery between intervals is very importantThe training pattern in zones 4 and 5 is ~~~ designed to produce peak performance.
The Polar sport zones can be personalized by using a laboratory measured HRmax value, or by taking a field

test to measure the value yourselfWhen exercising in a sport zone, try to make use of the entire zoneThe
mid-zone is a good target, but keeping your heart rate at that exact level all the time is not necessary.
Heart rate gradually adjusts to training intensityFor instance, when crossing from sport zone 1 to 3, the
circulatory system and heart rate will adjust in 3-5 minutes.
Heart rate responds to exercise intensity depending on factors such as fitness and recovery levels, as well
as environmental factorsIt is important to look out for subjective feelings of fatigue, and to adjust your
training program accordingly. ~~~ A simple way of making use of the sport zones is to work with target heart rate zonesFor further
instructions, see Plan Your Training (page 9).
After the exercise, exercise duration is displayed in sport zonesAccess the Weekly display to see in which
sport zones you have been exercising, and for how long.
The Polar ProTrainer 5 offers up to 10 sport zones to better serve your training needs and heart rate
reserve.
OwnZone Training
Your training computer determines automatically an individual and safe exercise intensity zone: your
OwnZoneThe unique Polar OwnZone defines your personal training zone for aerobic trainingThe function
guides you through your warm-up, and takes your present physical and mental condition into accountFor
most adults, OwnZone corresponds to 65-85% of maximum heart rate.
OwnZone can be determined in 1-5 minutes during a warm-up period by walking, jogging, or doing some
other sportThe idea is to start exercising slowly at a light intensity, and to gradually increase intensity
and heart rateOwnZone is developed for use by healthy peopleSome health conditions may cause heart
rate variability-based OwnZone determination to failThese conditions include high blood pressure,
cardiac arrhythmias, and certain medications.
Listening to and interpreting the signals your body sends during physical exertion is an important part of
getting fitSince warm-up routines differ for different types of exercise, and since your physical and
mental state may also vary from day to day (due to stress or illness), using the OwnZone function for every
session guarantees the most effective heart rate target zone for that particular type of exercise and day.
Maximum Heart Rate
Maximum heart rate (HRmax) is the highest number of heartbeats per minute (bpm) during maximum
physical exertionIt is individual and depends on age, hereditary factors, and fitness levelIt may also
vary according to the type of sport performedHRmax is used to express exercise intensity.
Determining Maximum Heart Rate
Your HR max can be determined in several ways.
The most accurate way is to have your HRmax clinically measured, usually on a maximal treadmill or by
taking a bicycle stress test supervised by a cardiologist or exercise physiologist.
You can also determine your HR max by taking a field test together with a training partner.
You can obtain a HR max-p score that predicts your HRmax by taking a Polar Fitness Test.
HRmax can also be estimated by using the commonly used formula: 220 - age, although research shows
that the method is not very accurate, especially for older persons or those who have been fit for many
54

years.




If you have done some hard training in recent weeks and know that you can safely reach maximum heart
rate, you can safely take a test to determine your HRmax yourselfHaving a training buddy with you during
the test is recommendedIf you are uncertain, consult your physician before undertaking the test.
Here is an example of a simple test.
Step 1: Warm up for 15 minutes on a flat surface, building up to your usual training pace.
Step 2: Choose a hill or stairwell that will take more than 2 minutes to climbRun up the hill/steps once,
building to as hard a pace as you can hold for 20 minutesReturn to the base of the hill/steps.
Step 3: Run up the hill/steps again, building towards a pace you could just about hold for 3 kilometers.
Note your highest heart rateYour maximum is approximately 10 beats higher than the noted value.
Step 4: Run back down the hill, allowing your heart rate to drop 30-40 beats per minute.
Step 5: Run up the hill/steps once again at a pace that you can only hold for 1 minuteTry to run halfway
up the hills/stepsNote your highest heart rateThis brings you close to your maximum heart rateUse this
value as your maximum heart rate to set training zones.
Step 6: Make sure you get a good cool-down, a minimum of 10 minutes.
Heart Rate Value in a Sitting Position
HRsit is your average heart rate when completely still (i.ewhile sitting)To easily determine HR sit, wear
your heart rate sensor, sit down, and do not engage in any physical activityFor a more precise
measurement, repeat the procedure several times and calculate your average.
Heart Rate Reserve
Heart rate reserve (HRR) is the difference between maximum heart rate (HRmax), and resting heart rate
(HRrest)HRR is used to calculate exercise heart ratesIt is the range within which heart rate varies
depending on exertion levelHRR equals oxygen uptake reserve (VO2R).
Exercise heart rate can be determined by using the Karvonen formulaAdd the given percentage of heart
rate reserve to resting heart rate.
Exercise HR = % of target intensity (HRmax – HRrest) + HRrest
Example:
Target intensity 70 % HRR for a person with HR max 201 bpm and HRrest 50 bpm
Exercise HR= 70% (201-50) + 50
Exercise HR=156 bpm
For a precise exercise heart rate, you need your exact HRmax and HRrestWhen using estimated HRmax,
exercise heart rate values are always estimates.
In Polar RS800CX training computer, the heart rate value during a resting state is measured in a sitting
position (HRsit)This is for practical reasons since HRsit is used in energy expenditure calculation because
of accuracyHR sit matches the low intensity to which different exercise intensities can be compared.
Karvonen M, Kentala K, Mustala OThe effects of training on heart rate: a longitudinal studyAnn Med
Exp Biol Fenn 1957; 35: 307-315.
Heart Rate Variability ~~~ Heart rate varies with every heartbeatHeart rate variability (HRV) is the variation of beat to beat intervals,
also known as R-R intervals.
Background Information
55
ENGLISH





HRV indicates the fluctuations of heart rate around an average heart rateAn average heart rate of 60
beats per minute (bpm) does not mean that the interval between successive heartbeats would be exactly
1.0 sec, instead they may fluctuate/vary from 0.5 sec up to 2.0 sec.
HRV is affected by aerobic fitnessHRV of a well-conditioned heart is generally large at restOther factors
that affect HRV are age, genetics, body position, time of day, and health statusDuring exercise, HRV
decreases as heart rate and exercise intensity increaseHRV also decreases during periods of mental
stress.
HRV is regulated by the autonomic nervous systemParasympathetic activity decreases heart rate and
increases HRV, whereas sympathetic activity increases heart rate and decreases HRV.
HRV is used in the Ownzone, OwnIndex, and in OwnOptimizer featuresIt can also be monitored on its
own using the training computerIf your HRV changes at a given pace and heart rate, this may indicate a
change in your training load and stress.
Running Cadence and Stride Length
Cadence is the number of times the foot with the stride sensor hits the ground per minute.
Stride length is the average length of one stepThat is the distance between your right and left foot
contacting the ground.
Running speed = 2 stride length cadence
There are two ways to run faster: moving your legs at a higher cadence or taking longer steps.
Elite long distance runners typically run with a high cadence of 85-95On uphills, typical cadence values
are lowerOn downhills they are higherRunners adjust stride length to gather speed: stride length
increases as speed increases.
Yet one of the most common mistakes novice runners make is over-stridingThe most efficient stride
length is the natural one – the one that feels most comfortableYou will run faster in races by
strengthening your leg muscles so they take you forward with a longer stride.
You should also work on maximizing cadence efficiencyCadence does not progress easily, but if properly
trained, you will be able to sustain it throughout your runs and maximize your performanceTo develop
cadence, the nerve-muscle connection needs to be trained - and reasonably frequentlyA session of
cadence training a week is a good startIncorporate some cadence work into the rest of your weekDuring
long easy runs, you could include some faster cadence every now and then.
When training for longer running events (½ Marathon, Marathon or longer), it may be helpful to monitor
cadenceA low cadence at expected race pace can cause problems later in the event, as your legs tire.

Background Information
ENGLISH
One way around this is to work on increasing leg speed at expected race paceYou can set your training
computer to show pace and cadenceTry to shorten your stride and increase cadence while holding the




same pace (set a narrow pace zone to give you audio feedback).You can aim to raise running cadence

above the following:
80/min (4hour Marathoners)
85/min (3hr 30min Marathoners)
88/min (3hour Marathoners)
This is a general guide only, taller runners will naturally have slightly lower cadencesRunners should also
tune in to what feels comfortable for them personally.
A good way of improving stride length is to undertake specific strength work, like running hills, running in
soft sand, or running up stepsA six-week training period including strength work should result in
noticeable improvements in stride length, and if combined with some faster leg speed work (such as short
strides at best 5km pace), noticeable improvements should be seen in overall speed, as well.

Optional s3/s3+ stride sensor W.I.N.Drequired.
R-R Recording
R-R recording rate saves heartbeat intervals, i.eintervals between successive heartbeatsThis information
is also shown as instantaneous heart rate in beats per minute in recorded samples.
When recording every single interval, extra systoles and artefacts can also be seenWe recommend using
contact gel (ECG gel) to optimize contact between your skin and the heart rate sensorReadings
interpreted as incorrect in the heart rate data can be adjusted and corrected with the software.
Polar Running Index
Running Index offers an easy way to monitor performance changesPerformance (how fast/easily you run
at a given pace) is directly influenced by aerobic fitness (VO2max) and exercise economy (how efficient
your body is at running), and Running Index is a measurement of this influenceBy recording your
Running Index over time, you can monitor progressImprovement means that running at a given pace
requires less of an effort, or that your pace is faster at a given level of exertionThe Running Index feature
calculates such improvementsRunning Index also gives you daily information on your running
performance level which may vary from day to day.
Benefits of Running Index:
emphasizes the positive effects of good training sessions and resting days.
monitors fitness and performance development at different heart rate levels - not only during maximal
performance.
you can determine your optimal running speed by comparing running indexes from different kinds of ~~~ trainings.
stresses progress through better running technique and fitness level.
Running Index is calculated during every exercise when heart rate and the s3/s3+ stride sensor/ G3/G5
GPS sensor signal is recorded, and when the following requirements apply:
speed should be 6km/h / 3,75 mi/h or faster and duration 12 minutes minimum.
heart rate should be above 40% HRmax.
Make sure that the stride sensor is calibratedCalculation begins when you start recording the session.
During the session, you may stop once at traffic lights, for example, without interrupting the calculation.
In the end, your training computer displays a Running Index value and stores the result in the File section.
Compare your result to the table belowUsing the software, you can monitor and analyze your progress in
Running Index values against time and different running speedsOr compare values from different
exercise sessions and analyze them in the short and long term.

Precautions
Interference During Exercise
Electromagnetic Interference and Exercise Equipment
Disturbance may occur near microware ovens and computersAlso WLAN base stations may cause
interference when exercising with RS800CXTo avoid erratic reading or misbehaviors, move away from

possible sources of disturbance.
Exercise equipment with electronic or electrical components such as LED displays, motors and electrical
brakes may cause interfering stray signalsTo solve these problems, try the following:
1.
2.
3.
Remove the heart rate sensor from your chest and use the exercise equipment as you would normally.
Move the training computer around until you find an area in which it displays no stray reading or does not
flash the heart symbolInterference is often worst directly in front of the display panel of the equipment,
while the left or right side of the display is relatively free of disturbance.
Put the heart rate sensor back on your chest and keep the training computer in this interference-free area
as much as possible.
If the training computer still does not work with the exercise equipment, it may be electrically too noisy
for wireless heart rate measurement.
Using RS800 Training Computer in Water
The training computer is water resistantHowever, heart rate measurement does not work in waterYou
can use the training computer under water as a watch but it is not a diving instrumentTo maintain water
resistance, do not press the buttons of the training computer under waterUsing the training computer in
excessive rainfall may also cause interference.
Minimizing Risks When Exercising
Exercise may include some riskBefore beginning a regular exercise program, it is recommended that you
answer the following questions concerning your health statusIf you answer yes to any of these questions,
we recommend that you consult a doctor before starting any training program.
Have you been physically inactive for the past 5 years?
Do you have high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol?
Are you taking any blood pressure or heart medication?
Do you have a history of breathing problems?
Do you have symptoms of any disease?
Are you recovering from a serious illness or medical treatment?

Do you use a pacemaker or other implanted electronic device?

Do you smoke?
Are you pregnant?
Note that in addition to exercise intensity, medications for heart conditions, blood pressure, psychological
conditions, asthma, breathing, etc., as well as some energy drinks, alcohol, and nicotine may also affect ~~~ heart rate.
It is important to be sensitive to your body’s responses during exerciseIf you feel unexpected pain or
excessive fatigue when exercising, it is recommended that you stop the exercise or continue at a lighter
intensity.
Note!
If you are using a pacemaker, you can use Polar training computersIn theory interference to
pacemaker caused by Polar products should not be possibleIn practice no reports exist to suggest anyone
ever having experienced interferenceWe cannot however issue an official guarantee on our products'

suitability with all pacemakers or other implanted devices due to the variety of devices availableIf you
have any doubts, or if you experience any unusual sensations while using Polar products, please consult

your physician or contact the implanted electronic device manufacturer to determine safety in your case.
If you are allergic to any substance that comes into contact with your skin or if you suspect an allergic
reaction due to using the product, check the listed materials in Technical SpecificationsTo avoid any
skin reaction to the heart rate sensor, wear it over a shirt, but moisten the shirt well under the electrodes
to ensure flawless operation.
Your safety is important to usThe shape of the s3/s3+ stride sensor is designed to minimize the
possibility of it getting caught in somethingIn any case, be careful when running with the stride sensor in
brushwood, for example.
The combined impact of moisture and intense abrasion may cause a black color to come off the heart rate sensor’s
surface, possibly staining light-colored clothesIf you use insect repellent on your skin, you must ensure that it
does not come into contact with the heart rate sensor.

3D FUNCTION
3D FUNCTION
3D technology uses different video frames for each eye to add depth to the video.
While Watching 3D

WARNING
yy If you view 3D video or images too
closely for a long period of time, your
eyesight may become worse.
yy If you watch the projector or game
screen for a long time with 3D glasses

on, you may experience dizziness or
eye fatigue.
yy People with chronic diseases
(epilepsy, cardiovascular disease,
blood pressure-related diseases,
etc.
), pregnant women, and people
with serious motion sickness should
avoid watching 3D video.
yy People with stereo blindness, or with
stereopsis problems, should also

avoid watching 3D video contentIt
may cause double vision or visual
discomfort.
yy People with strabismus, amblyopia,
or astigmatism may have difficulty
perceiving video depth and may be
fatigued easily due to double vision
or other ailmentsIt is recommended
to rest more frequently than other
viewers.

yy Because 3D can be recognized as
real, some viewers may get surprised
or overexcited.
yy Do not watch 3D images near fragile
objects or any objects that can be
knocked over easily.
yy Take care not to injure yourself as
you may subconsciously try to move
away from the life-like 3D images.

3D FUNCTION
yy Warning about photosensitivity
seizures
- Some users may experience a
seizure or other abnormal symptoms
when they are exposed to a flashing
light or particular patterns from a
video gameIf anyone in your family
has a history of epilepsy or has ever
experienced any kind of seizure,
please consult your doctor before
viewing 3D images.
If you experience one of the following
symptoms while watching a 3D
video, stop watching the 3D video
immediately and take a rest.

- Dizziness, switched eyesight,
twitching of the eye or facial
muscles, involuntary movements,
cramp, loss of consciousness,
confusion, loss of sense of direction,
or nauseaIf the symptom does
not disappear, please consult your ~~~ doctor.
yy You can reduce the risk of
photosensitive seizures by taking the
following preventive measures.
- Take a rest of 5 to 15 minsfor every
1 hour of viewing.
- If vision varies between each eye,
correct the variation before beginning
to watch a 3D video.
- Ensure that the 3D video is directly in
front of you, at eye level.
- You should stop watching if you
experience a headache, fatigue or
dizziness.
- Do not view 3D images for a long
period of time when you are tired or ill.
49
CAUTION
yy Extra special care is required for
children watching a 3D video.
When Watching 3D Video
yy Prevent children of 5 years or
younger from watching a 3D videoIt
may impair the development of their
eyes.
yy Children 10 years old or younger are
still developing their eyesight and may
have an excessive tendency to touch
or jump at the screenAdult guidance
and supervision is recommended.
yy Since the distance between the eyes
is narrower for children than in adults,
children tend to notice a greater
difference in the images seen by each
eyeTherefore, even while watching
the same 3D video, children may
have a greater depth perception than
adults.
yy Young people of 19 years old or
younger may respond with sensitivity
to the light stimuli of 3D content.
Excessive viewing when fatigued is
not recommended.
yy Elderly viewers may have a reduced
depth perception than younger
viewersAvoid watching video nearer
than the recommended distance.
yy Watch 3D images within the optimum
viewing angle and distance.
yy If you are outside the viewing angle
or distance, you may not be able to
see 3D imagesYou cannot view 3D
images when you are lying down.
50
3D FUNCTION
yy You may see left and right images
overlapped during projector
initialization after it is powered onIt
may take some time for optimization.

yy It may take some time for the 3D
image to look normal after you turn
your eyes away from the screen and
look back at the 3D image.

yy It may flicker slightly while watching
3D images under a 3 wavelength
lamp fluorescent light (50 Hz to
60 Hz) or near windowsIf so, it is

recommended to block the sun light
with a curtain and to dim the lights.
yy The 3D glasses must be DLP-LINK
(DLP Ready) type.
yy You may not be able to watch 3D
properly if there is an obstacle
between the projector and 3D
glasses. ~~~ yy Install the 3D projector as far as
possible from other devices.
yy If a future 3D broadcasting format
that is not supported by this projector
becomes the standard, an additional
device such as a set-top box may be ~~~ required.
Please check the following when
using 3D glasses.
yy Do not use 3D glasses as ordinary

glasses, sunglasses or protective
goggles.
- If you do so, this may cause injury.
yy Do not store 3D glasses in very hot
or very cold conditionsIf you do, this
may cause them to become distorted.
Do not use distorted glasses.
yy Do not drop 3D glasses or allow
them to come into contact with other ~~~ objects.
- This may cause product malfunction.
yy The lenses of 3D glasses are easily
scratchedUse a soft clean cloth
when cleaning them.
yy Foreign particles on the cloth may
cause scratches.
yy Do not scratch the surface of the 3D
glasses' lenses with sharp objects
or wipe them with chemicalsIf the
lenses get scratched, images may not
look normal when viewing 3D.

OPEN SOURCE LICENSE
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991 ~~~ Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. ~~~ Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change itBy contrast, the GNU
General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its usersThis General Public License applies to most of the Free
Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License ~~~ instead.)
You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not priceOur General Public Licenses are designed to
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rightsThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, ~~~ or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all
the rights that you haveYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source codeAnd you must show
them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free softwareIf the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patentsWe wish to avoid the danger that redistributors
of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietaryTo prevent this, we
have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION ~~~ APPENDIX
178
0This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
may be distributed under the terms of this General Public LicenseThe "Program", below, refers to any such program
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that
is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into
another language(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) ~~~ Each licensee is ~~~ addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running
the Program)Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
1You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of
any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program. ~~~ You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in ~~~ exchange for a fee.
2You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any ~~~ change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running
for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License(Exception:
if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a wholeIf identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its
terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate worksBut when you distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on
the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.
3You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or, ~~~ c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code(This
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) ~~~ APPENDIX
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to itFor an executable
work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executableHowever, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
179
APPENDIX
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this LicenseHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed itHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative worksThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not ccept
this LicenseTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate
your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Program or works based on it.
6Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditionsYou
may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereinYou are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
7If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this LicenseIf you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at allFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it
and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system, which is implemented by public license practicesMany people have made generous contributions to the wide
range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot ~~~ impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
8If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excludedIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to
timeSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems ~~~ or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version numberIf the Program specifies a version number of this License which
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of
any later version published by the Free Software FoundationIf the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
APPENDIX
180
10If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different,
write to the author to ask for permissionFor software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to
the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for thisOur decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software ~~~ generally.
NO WARRANTY ~~~ 11BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSETHE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOUSHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to
achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the programIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to
where the full notice is found.
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; ~~~ type `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer"
for the program, if necessaryHere is a sample; alter the names:

Version 2.1, February 1999
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301
USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPLIt also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public
License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change itBy contrast, the GNU
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically
libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use itYou can use it too, but we suggest
you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in
any particular case, based on the explanations below.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not priceOur General Public Licenses are
designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to
surrender these rightsThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the ~~~ library or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the
rights that we gave youYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source codeIf you link other code
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library
after making changes to the library and recompiling itAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which
gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free libraryAlso, if the
library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original
version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free programWe wish to make sure that a
company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom
of use specified in this license.
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public LicenseThis license,
the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary
General Public LicenseWe use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free
programs.
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original libraryThe ordinary General Public License therefore permits
such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedomThe Lesser General Public License permits more
lax criteria for linking other code with the library.
APPENDIX
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the
ordinary General Public LicenseIt also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programsThese disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
librariesHowever, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library,
so that it becomes a de-facto standardTo achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the libraryA more
frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free librariesIn this case, there is little to
gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use
a large body of free softwareFor example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
182
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a
program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification followPay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library"The former contains code derived from
the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public
License (also called "this License")Each licensee is addressed as "you".
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these termsA
"work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into
another language(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to itFor a library, complete
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus
the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it)Whether
that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. ~~~ 1You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. ~~~ You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection ~~~ in exchange for a fee. ~~~ 2You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library,
and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all ~~~ of these conditions:
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of ~~~ any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License. ~~~ d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program
that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good
faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,
and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
These requirements apply to the modified work as a wholeIf identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its
terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate worksBut when you distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
APPENDIX
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of
the applicationTherefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function
must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
183
APPENDIX ~~~ Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the
Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy
of the LibraryTo do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU
General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU
General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) ~~~ Do not make any other ~~~ change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
4You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a ~~~ medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
5A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library"Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library"The executable is therefore covered by this LicenseSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the
work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.
The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and
small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it
is legally a derivative work(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under ~~~ Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of
Section 6Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with ~~~ the Library itself.
6As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its
use are covered by this LicenseYou must supply a copy of this LicenseIf the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the
user to the copy of this LicenseAlso, you must do one of these things: ~~~ APPENDIX
184
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including
whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work
is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object
code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable
containing the modified Library(It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the LibraryA suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at
run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions
into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as
long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to
copy the above specified materials from the same place.
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs
needed for reproducing the executable from itHowever, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable. ~~~ It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating systemSuch a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in ~~~ an executable that you distribute.
7You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with
other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that ~~~ you do these two things:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
library facilitiesThis must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and
explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
LicenseAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this LicenseHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
9You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed itHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative worksThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
this LicenseTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or ~~~ works based on it.
10Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditionsYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
11If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this LicenseIf you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at allFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
12If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excludedIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
APPENDIX ~~~ It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system which is implemented by public license practicesMany people have made generous contributions to the wide
range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot ~~~ impose that choice.
185
APPENDIX
13The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License
from time to timeSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns. ~~~ Each version is given a distinguishing version numberIf the Library specifies a version number of this License which
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of
any later version published by the Free Software FoundationIf the Library does not specify a license version number,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
14If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permissionFor software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for thisOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing ~~~ and reuse of software generally. ~~~ NO WARRANTY
15BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY,
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSETHE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOUSHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Notes for recording



Disc types and recording formats, modes,
and settings
This recorder can play various kinds of DVD discs:
pre-recorded DVD-Video discs, DVD-RW,
DVD-R, DVD+RW and DVD+R discsThe disc format
for DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD+RW discs is always “Video
format”—the same as pre-recorded DVD-Video discs.
This means that once finalized, you can play a
DVD-R, DVD+R, or DVD+RW in a regular DVD
player.
By default, the DVD-RW disc format is Video format,
though you can change this to Video Recording (VR)
format, if required(Reinitializing the disc will erase
the contents of the disc.)
The recording mode is closely related to the disc
formatIf the disc format is Video Recording format,
then the recording mode is VR mode; if the disc
format is Video mode, then the recording mode is
Video mode (except for DVD-Video, which is not
recordable, and so does not have a recording mode).
Within the recording modes (which are fixed for them
whole disc) are the record settingsThese can be
changed as required for each recording and
determine the picture quality and how much space the
recording will take up on the disc.
About HDD recording
Recording to the internal hard disk drive (HDD) is
basically similar to recording to a VR mode DVD-RW
discYou have the full choice of recording quality
options, including the manual mode, and of course
you can record, erase and re-record as many times as
you likeThe capacity of the hard disk drive means
that you can store many hours of video on it, even in
the higher quality recording modesTo help you
organize the contents, the HDD is divided into ten
genreYou can name and use these genres as you
like—for example, you might have a genre for movies,
another for TV shows, and one for camcorder
recordings.
The recording times shown are not exact because
the recorder uses variable bit-rate video
compressionThis means that the exact recording
time will depend on the material being recorded.
When recording a TV broadcast, if the reception is
poor or the picture contains interference, the
recording times may be shorter.
If you record still pictures or audio only, the
recording time may be longer.
The displayed times for recording and time
remaining may not always add up to exactly the ~~~ length of the disc.
The recording time available may decrease if you
heavily edit a disc.
If using a DVD-RW disc, make sure you change the
recording format (Video mode or VR mode) before
you record anything on the discSee page 20 (Disc
Format) for how to do this.
When using a DVD-R or DVD+R disc, you can keep
recording until the disc is full, or until you finalize the
discBefore you start a recording session, check
the amount of recording time left on the disc.
When using a DVD-RW disc in Video mode,
recording time available will only increase if you
erase the last title recorded on the disc.
The Delete Title option in the Title List (Original)
menu only hides the title, it does not actually erase
the title from the disc and increase the recording
time available (except for the last recorded title on a
DVD-RW disc in Video mode).
When using a DVD+R/RW, the recorder will execute
the Menu-making operation to update the new title
and editing when removing the disc from the recorder
or turn off the recorderSo you must remove the disc
after selecting the recorder’s operation mode to DVD ~~~ mode.
This unit can record TV program to HDD onlyIf you
try to record TV program in DVD mode, the unit
automatically change the mode to HDD then start
recording.

with similar commands for erasing and naming titles,
as well as fine control over the content of chapters
within titles for DVD disc.

Digital channels have a Physical, Major, and Minor

channel numberThe Physical number is the actual
digital channel number, the Major is the number that
the channel should be mapped to, and the Minor is

the sub-channelSince the ATSC tuner automatically
maps the channel from the Major / Minor number,
the Physical number is not required when sending a














command in Digital.
